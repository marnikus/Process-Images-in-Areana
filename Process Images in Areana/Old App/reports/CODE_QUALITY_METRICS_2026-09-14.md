# Code quality audit — 2026-09-14

Snapshot: `5197ce0` ("upd"), branch `arena/01a0a11b-chat-v-bot`. No production
code was changed to produce this audit; every number below was re-measured from
this tree with the commands in **Reproduction**.

Scope: **208 production Python files** (2,268 functions, 279 classes) under
`core`, `actions`, `backend`, `bridge`, `services`, `stores`, `app`, plus
`main.py` — and, for the first time in an audit of this repo, the **30
JavaScript files / 11,865 lines** of the frontend, because that is now where
the largest artefacts live.

## Executive summary

**Complexity is closed. Python size is closing. JavaScript is the open flank.**

* **Complexity: clean and it stays clean.** 0 of 2,268 functions exceed cyclomatic
  complexity 10 (max exactly 10), 0 exceed cognitive complexity 15 (max 15),
  0 nest deeper than 4. Mean CC 2.98, mean cognitive 2.02. The user's thresholds
  (CC ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, nesting ≤ 3–4) are met with nothing at the ceiling
  except one function that sits *on* it.
* **Python size: the tail that Round F/G attacked is measurably smaller.** Files
  over 500 lines fell 10 → 4; files over 300 fell 29 → 23; mean MI rose 64.85 →
  **68.05**; the MI floor rose 11.1 → **24.9**. What remains is 23 files in the
  300–600 range and 36 classes over the 150-LOC gate line.
* **The frontend is now the largest un-gated mass in the repository.** 30 files /
  11,865 lines; the biggest file (`ui/js/sash-grid.js`, 1,361 lines) is 2.3× the
  biggest Python file; the biggest object (`SashGrid`, 1,331 LOC / 69 methods) is
  2.8× the biggest Python class; the biggest functions
  (`ui/js/app.js::setupBridgeListeners` 205 LOC, `ui/js/stack-dnd.js::_showConfig`
  180 LOC) are 3.3–3.8× the biggest Python function that is *not* an embedded JS
  payload (`stores/history_db.py::init`, 54). **9.2% of measured JS functions exceed 30 lines against 1.7% in
  Python**, and RULE 16 — which gates Python on exactly that line — does not see
  JavaScript at all. This is the single biggest structural gap.
* **Tests are the strongest they have ever measured, and the weakest exactly
  where the code is worst.** 3,172 passed / 0 failed, line **92.64%**, branch
  **88.03%**, mutation **99.37%** (158 killed / 1 survivor / 982 unreachable),
  ratio 1 : 1.57. But the worst-maintainability Python files are also the least
  covered: `bridge/history_bridge.py` MI 24.9 / **66.4%**, `backend/cdp_client.py`
  MI 36.7 / **65.2%**, `backend/message_injector_send.py` **26.3%**.
* **JavaScript has a number now, and it is a mixed one.** 82.8% line coverage
  (8,822/10,656 executable) across 30 files, 29/29 Node suites green — but six
  files are never loaded by any test (1,239 LOC, including `ui/js/app.js`, the
  application entry point), and the two biggest files are the weakest of the
  loaded ones (`sash-grid.js` 64.2%, `stack-dnd.js` 67.8%).

The direction of travel is right on every Python axis. The new number is the
JavaScript column, and it says the frontend never received the treatment the
Python side has had for four rounds.

## 1. Complexity and size against your thresholds

### 1a. Complexity — passes, with room

| Measure | Your threshold | Measured (Python) | Verdict |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Cyclomatic complexity (max) | ≤ 10 | **10** | ✅ met exactly, none above |
| Functions with CC > 10 | 0 | **0 / 2,268** | ✅ closed |
| Mean CC | — | 2.98 (median 2, p95 8) | healthy |
| Cognitive complexity (max) | ≤ 15 | **15** | ✅ met exactly, none above |
| Functions with cognitive > 15 | 0 | **0** | ✅ closed in Round G (was 2) |
| Nesting depth (max) | ≤ 3–4 | **4** | ✅ at the loose bound |
| Functions with nesting > 4 | 0 | **0** | ✅ closed |

### 1b. Size — the Python tail that remains

| Measure | Your threshold | Measured | Verdict |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Function length (max) | ≤ 20–30 LOC | **107** (`dom_probe::build_probe`, embedded JS literal) | ⚠️ documented §16.1.5 |
| Longest function that is *not* a JS literal | ≤ 20–30 LOC | **54** (`history_db::init`) | ⚠️ |
| Mean / median function LOC | — | 9.19 / 7 | ✅ |
| Functions 4–20 LOC ("ideal band") | most | **1,418 (62.5%)** | ✅ |
| Functions > 30 LOC | few | **39 (1.7%)** | ✅ minuscule tail |
| Class size (max) | ≤ 200–300 LOC | **467** (`HistoryBridge`) | ❌ 1.6× the loose bound |
| Classes > 300 LOC | 0 | **6 (2.2%)** | ❌ |
| Classes > 150 LOC (gate line) | 0 | **36 (12.9%)** | ❌ |
| Methods per class (max) | ≤ 10–15 | **44** (`HistoryRepo`, deliberate facade) | ⚠️ see §2 |
| Classes > 15 methods | 0 | **24 (8.6%)** | ❌ |
| Parameters (max) | ≤ 3–4 | **20** (`actions/scroll_parse.py::__init__`) | ⚠️ RULE 3 legacy block |
| Functions > 4 params | few | **11 (0.5%)** | ✅ RULE-3 floor, 9 documented overrides |
| File size (max) | ≤ ~300 | **601** (`backend/history_query.py`) | ❌ 2× |
| Files > 500 lines | 0 | **4** | ❌ |
| Files > 300 lines | few | **23 (11.1%)** | ⚠️ |

**The four files over 500 lines**, worst maintainability first:

| Lines | SLOC | MI | Coverage | File |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 544 | 450 | **24.9** | 66.4% | `bridge/history_bridge.py` |
| 601 | 417 | 35.3 | 97.8% | `backend/history_query.py` |
| 511 | 319 | 40.9 | 85.8% | `backend/config_manager.py` |
| 514 | 371 | 54.9 | 96.8% | `backend/dom_highlight.py` |

**Biggest classes** (LOC / methods / LCOM\*):

| LOC | Methods | LCOM\* | Class | Reading |
|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| 467 | 31 | 0.86 | `bridge/history_bridge.py::HistoryBridge` | genuine — 31 substantive slots |

### 1c. JavaScript — the unmeasured half (new)

| Measure | Python (RULE 16 gate) | JavaScript (measured today) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Files measured | 208 | **30** |
| Lines | 26,333 nonblank/noncomment | **11,865 physical** |
| Largest file | 601 lines | **1,361 lines** (`ui/js/sash-grid.js`) |
| Second largest | 544 | **1,341** (`ui/js/stack-dnd.js`) |
| Largest class/object | 467 LOC / 31 methods | **1,331 LOC / 69 methods** (`SashGrid`) |
| Second | 407 / 25 | **1,168 LOC / 58 methods** (`StackDnD`) |
| Longest function | 54 (real logic) | **205** (`app.js::setupBridgeListeners`) |
| Functions > 30 lines | 39 / 2,268 = **1.7%** | 50 / 546 = **9.2%** |
| Functions > 60 lines | 0 | **10** |
| Complexity gate | CC ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 15, nesting ≤ 4 | **no measurement exists** |
| Size gate | fail > 30 LOC function, > 150 LOC class | **no measurement exists** |
| Coverage floor | ≥ 80% line / ≥ 75% branch | none (82.8% measured, not gated) |

Measured with the round's own scanner (`node /tmp/jsfn.js`, reproduction below):
546 functions/object methods in 30 files, 50 over the 30-LOC fail line, 10 over
60, 2 over 100.

## 2. Coupling and cohesion

### Stability (Ca = used-by, Ce = depends-on, I = Ce/(Ca+Ce))

**Most depended-upon — correctly stable (I ≈ 0):** `core.events` (Ca 27, Ce 0),
`backend.cdp_client` (21/0), `core.result` (17/0), `stores.history_models`
(13/0), `actions.speed` (10/0), `services.collector_states` (8/0).

**Most dependent — correctly unstable (I ≈ 1):** `bridge.router` (1/20, I 0.95),
`services.run.coordinator` (1/15, 0.94), `services.undo_service` (3/14, 0.82),
`services.history` (2/12, 0.86), `services.collector_service` (3/11, 0.79),
`backend.config_manager` (3/10, 0.77), `app.bootstrap` (2/9, 0.82),
`services.bot_chat` (1/7, 0.88).

Every module with I ≥ 0.77 is a composition root, coordinator or router — the
job description of a thing that depends on many and is depended on by nobody.
**The dependency graph does not need repair.**

### Cohesion (LCOM\*)

170 classes with ≥ 2 methods and ≥ 1 field: **mean 0.594, median 0.676, 67.1%
at or above 0.5, 56 at or above 0.85.** Raw LCOM is a triage signal, not a gate
(the audit of 2026-09-12 explains why: parameter objects and result variants
score 1.00 by construction). Splitting the ≥ 0.85 set by *delegation share* —
the fraction of methods under 4 lines — separates two very different shapes:

* **Delegation facades (57–86% of methods are one-liners)** — the house pattern,
  not debt: `HistoryRepo` (44 methods, 86%), `UndoService` (86%), `Collector`
  (85%), `HistoryExportService` (79%), `PeopleBridge` (75%), `MediaStore` (73%),
  `ScrollParser` (57%). These are routers over a prefix family; "fixing" them by
  splitting would recreate the same shape one level down.
* **Genuinely incoherent (0–36% delegation, large, LCOM ≥ 0.85) — the real list:**
  `RunCoordinator` 0.97/182/17, `RunQueueMixin` 0.94/227/22, `ClickUser`
  0.93/225/14, `CDPClient` 0.91/208/21, `SyncSession` 0.91/178/17, `ChatParser`
  0.94/133/13, `PeopleBridge`→(see above), `HistoryBridge` 0.86/467/31,
  `HistoryDB` 0.86/232/30, `DbLifecycle` 0.88/276/22, `LabelStore` 0.89/222/38,
  `UndoBridge` 0.86/165/15, `HistoryMutateService` 0.86/164/15, `DbBridge`
  0.86/142/12, `RunExecutionMixin` 0.88/163/11, `RunLifecycleMixin` 0.89/124/10,
  `CollectPhaseMixin` 0.92/90/7, `ConfigManager` 0.87/177/20.

## 3. Test quality

| Measure | Your threshold | Measured | Verdict |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Python tests passing | all | **3,172 / 0 failed** (528 s) | ✅ |
| Skipped / deselected / xfailed | — | 2 / 1 / 1 | documented below |
| Subtests | — | **902 passed** | ✅ |
| Line coverage | ≥ 80% | **92.64%** (15,745 / 16,995) | ✅ +12.6 pp |
| Branch coverage | ≥ 75% | **88.03%** (3,514 / 3,992) | ✅ +13.0 pp |
| Mutation score | ≥ 70% | **99.37%** (158 killed, 1 survived, 982 unreachable) | ✅ |
| Test : production ratio | ~1 : 1 | **1 : 1.57** | ✅ |
| JS test entrypoints | all pass | **29 / 29** | ✅ |
| JS line coverage | none exists | **82.8%** (8,822 / 10,656) | measurement only |

**Mutation — one survivor left.** The configured job (`setup.cfg`) covers
`backend/history_query.py`: 1,141 mutants generated, **982 unreachable** ("no
tests" — excluded by the documented convention, count reported so neither number
can be quoted selectively), 158 killed, **1 survivor**:
`HistoryQuery._my_nicks` mutant 7. The 2026-09-12 audit recorded 9 survivors; the
Round G test-debt step killed eight of them. The reachable score is
**158/159 = 99.37%**.

**Deselect/skip:** one deselected (`tests/test_sash_webengine.py::
TestSashWebEngine::test_grid_in_real_webengine` — needs a real WebEngine), 2 skips
and 1 xfail are pre-existing conditional/environment guards.

**Lowest-covered Python modules** (≥ 30 statements) — note how they overlap the
worst-MI list:

| Coverage | Missing | File | Why it matters |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| **26.3%** | 42 | `backend/message_injector_send.py` | the send path of the message composer |
| 65.2% | 80 | `backend/cdp_client.py` | every CDP call goes through it |
| **66.4%** | 122 | `bridge/history_bridge.py` | worst MI in the project |
| 66.7% | 23 | `app/lifecycle.py` | app boot/shutdown |
| 69.3% | 35 | `services/db_deletion_flow_remove.py` | archive deletion |
| 70.1% | 29 | `bridge/layout_bridge.py` | grid layout slots |
| 70.7% | 48 | `services/db_registry.py` | world switching |
| 79.5% | 55 | `stores/media_fetch.py` | media recovery |

**JavaScript coverage, re-measured at this snapshot** (`tools/metrics/
js_coverage.py`, 30 files — the baseline report of 2026-09-13 recorded 24 files /
80.18%, so the denominator changed; the two are not directly comparable):

| Coverage | Lines | File |
|---:|---:|---|
| 0.0% | 510 | `ui/js/app.js` — the app entry point, never loaded by a test |
| 0.0% | 356 | `ui/js/stack-drag.js` |
| 0.0% | 168 | `ui/js/url-toolbar.js` |
| 0.0% | 85 | `ui/js/criteria-editor.js` |
| 0.0% | 81 | `ui/js/composer.js` |
| 0.0% | 39 | `ui/js/log-console.js` |
| **47.3%** | 474 | `ui/js/presets-ui.js` |
| **64.2%** | 1,361 | `ui/js/sash-grid.js` |
| 66.1% | 448 | `ui/js/user-table.js` |
| **67.8%** | 1,341 | `ui/js/stack-dnd.js` |
| 70.7% | 458 | `ui/js/history-store.js` |
| 73.1% | 376 | `ui/js/window-presets.js` |
| 82.9% | 76 | `ui/js/bot-messages.js` |
| 94.3–100% | — | the other 17 files |

Six files (1,239 LOC) are never loaded by any Node test — the JS analogue of an
uncovered module, and `app.js` is the one that wires the whole application.

## 4. Code smells

**Duplication.** Two scanners, two answers, both reported:
`tools/metrics/current_audit.py` (exact clones) finds **3 groups / 54 lines**;
`tools/metrics/clone_scan.py` (AST window ≥ 6 lines) finds **13 groups / 96
lines** — all 13 are the frozen `CLONE_BASELINE` in `rule16_gate.py`, verified
once more with `--with-clones`: **0 new, 0 stale**. Inspected: every group is a
shared import header, not copied logic. Behavioural duplication remains zero.

**Dead code.** `vulture --min-confidence 90`: **7 findings**, unchanged since
2026-09-12 — `actions/registry.py:18` (`Iterator`), `backend/cdp_client.py:35`
(`exc_type`, `tb`), `services/run/coordinator.py:62` (`scroll_parser`),
`services/run/hooks.py:68/71/74` (`coordinator`).

**Long methods / god classes.** The 39 functions over 30 LOC and 36 classes over
150 LOC tabulated in §1b. The four genuinely large *and* incoherent classes are
`HistoryBridge` (467/31/0.86), `DbLifecycle` (276/22/0.88), `RunQueueMixin`
(227/22/0.94) and `ClickUser` (225/14/0.93).

**Feature envy / boundary violations.** Not machine-measured in this repo; four
instances found by inspection, all of the same shape (one module reaching for
another's private member): `bridge/router.py:471` (`ctx.undo._history_entry`),
`bridge/undo_bridge.py:178` (`self.undo_service._clean_history`),
`services/db_service.py:160/163` (`self.registry._remember` /
`._prune_remembered`), `services/history/query.py:97/132/139`
(`self.media._dirs`, `self.collector._nick`, `self.collector._last_sync_reason`).
Either those members are public and want the name, or the caller should not need
them. Note the many `self.p._x` accesses inside the Round-G part classes are the
documented *part* pattern (a part holds its host), not this smell.

## 5. Maintainability

**Maintainability index** (radon, 0–100, higher is better) over 208 files:
**mean 68.05, median 65.3, minimum 24.9.** 16 files (7.7%) score below 40; none
below 20. Worst first:

| MI | Lines | Coverage | File |
|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **24.9** | 544 | 66.4% | `bridge/history_bridge.py` |
| 30.6 | 326 | 100% | `services/window_preset_service.py` |
| 31.0 | 314 | 92.0% | `services/run/progress.py` |
| 31.5 | 464 | 79.5% | `stores/media_fetch.py` |
| 32.2 | 151 | 97.2% | `services/run/hooks.py` |
| 33.0 | 425 | 98.0% | `services/collector_tick.py` |
| 33.7 | 128 | 95.4% | `app/window.py` |
| 34.9 | 294 | 96.2% | `services/history/mutate.py` |
| 35.3 | 601 | 97.8% | `backend/history_query.py` |
| 35.5 | 229 | 93.4% | `stores/label_assignments.py` |

`window_preset_service.py` (MI 30.6 in 326 lines) and `run/progress.py`
(MI 31.0 in 314) remain what the 2026-09-12 audit called them: **dense, not
big** — a size-driven sort does not see them. `history_bridge.py` at 24.9 is the
project's single worst file, and it is also 34% uncovered.

**Technical debt ratio, churn, bug density — still not honestly measurable.**
No tool in this repo produces a remediation-cost estimate; the checkout history
is 2 commits (both whole-repo imports), which is not enough for a churn signal;
and there is no defect labelling to attribute bugs to files. They are named here
as unavailable rather than invented.

## 6. Structured next phases — Round H

Ordered by measured impact, with the two owner decisions this evidence forces:

1. **The frontend (30 files / 11,865 lines) has no size gate and two god
   objects.** `SashGrid` (1,331/69) and `StackDnD` (1,168/58) are the largest
   classes in the project by every measure; `_showConfig` (180) and
   `setupBridgeListeners` (205) are its longest functions; and 1,239 LOC are
   loaded by no test at all. **Area A.**
2. **Python's 500-line class of files plus its worst-MI file.** `history_bridge.py`
   (544 / MI 24.9 / 66.4% covered) and `history_query.py` (601 / MI 35.3) are the
   two biggest correctness-bearing surfaces in the archive path. **Area B.**
3. **Service/store cohesion and the dense-file outliers.** 17 genuinely
   incoherent classes, the MI-density cases, and the 300–500 band. **Area C.**
4. **Verification debt.** One mutation job for one module, a coverage gap that
   sits precisely on the risky files, and the class of defect (a fake inventing
   an interface) that let a dead feature ship green. **Area D.**

The plan — four areas, each with its own file ownership so they can be developed
independently — is `docs/archive/2026-09-14-round-h/ROUND_H_DESIGN_2026-09-14.md`.

Raw evidence for this session lives **outside** the Git checkout
(`/tmp/audit_h.json`, `/tmp/coverage_h.json`, `/tmp/js_cov_h.json`,
`/tmp/mutmut_results.txt`): coverage and mutmut artefacts are not gitignored, and
`mutmut` leaves an untracked `mutants/` directory that was removed after the run.
