"""BotBridge — the AI Bot Chat and Prompt Editor windows' wire.

Reads and Grok calls are asynchronous, so a @Slot cannot answer inline: JS
passes a `req_id` and Python answers on `bot_reply_ready` carrying the same
id (the pattern HistoryBridge established — two windows can ask at once
without answers crossing). Failures answer on `bot_error`, so a window can
say *why* it has no suggestion (RULE 4) instead of waiting forever.

This bridge is the AI Bot Chat window ALONE. The Grok Prompt Editor is a
separate window and has its own bridge (`bridge/bot_prompt_bridge.py`) — the
same separation the feature requires of the UI, and what keeps each class
inside RULE 16's method budget. The shared plumbing (`_emit_answer`,
`_guarded`, `schedule`) lives in module functions both bridges import, so
neither spends a method on it.
