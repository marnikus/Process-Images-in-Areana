"""BaseAction and the small shared skeleton the blocks are built on.

The registry (actions/registry.py) and the run-time context
(actions/context.py) used to live here with it; they are separate modules
now, so this file holds the interface plus what several blocks genuinely have
in common:

  BaseAction        — what every block must provide (execute, settings
                      round-trip, the panel schema).
  BlockField        — ONE setting, declared once: its panel entry, its
                      cleaning, and which visual-click keyword it feeds.
  DeclaredSettings  — the plumbing that turns a tuple of BlockFields into a
                      constructor, a `to_dict()` and a `config_schema()` that
                      cannot drift apart.
  FindClickBlock    — the family that finds something on the page and clicks
                      it visibly (RULE 1: the clicking is `visual_click`'s).
  MarkerBlock       — the family the engine drives itself.
