"""Mark Person as Messaged — flip the {{nick}} person to Status Done.

Memory-driven, single person per run — NOT the queue: the block marks the
nick saved in this run's {{nick}} memory (Pick Person / an earlier Click
User) in the People list. It never looks at the queued users, and it marks
only when the person actually exists in the People list.

  * no nick saved this run  → ❌ fail loudly (nothing marked blindly);
  * nick not in the list    → ❌ fail ("if exist in memory");
  * already messaged        → OK, informational (idempotent);
  * marked now              → ✅ plus the live grid row update the engine
                              uses for its automatic marking.
