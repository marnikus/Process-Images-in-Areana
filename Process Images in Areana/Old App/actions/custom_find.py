"""Configurable "Find & Click" block (CUSTOM_FIND).

A generic, reusable search-and-click action: `selector` is the clickable
rectangle to find, `label_selector` the element inside it whose text is
searched, `match_text` the text to find (empty = the first one), `click_selector`
the element INSIDE to click (empty = the found element itself), and
`click_enabled` whether to click at all. `custom_name` is what the stack shows.

Execution is the shared two-phase runner (docs/archive/2026-09-10-agent-rules-v1/AGENT_RULES.md RULE 1):

  1. FIND  — logs success/failure and draws a thin RED outline on the detected
     element, then pauses so the user can confirm it is the right one.
  2. CLICK — logs whether the element is clickable, draws a thin ORANGE outline
     over the click target area, then performs the click.

The block is a constructor: every instance can be customised through the UI
config panel and saved as a reusable preset, so its settings are declared as
`BlockField`s and the panel schema is derived from them (RULE 4 for blocks: the
schema and the saved dictionary come from one list and cannot drift).
