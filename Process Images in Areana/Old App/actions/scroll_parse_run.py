"""The scroll run itself — `ScrollParse`'s builders and pipeline (G7 §4.2).

`ScrollParse` (actions/scroll_parse.py) is the RULE 3 block wire: its
`__init__` keyword list, the knob insertion order, `to_dict` and
`config_schema` are pinned byte-for-byte (tests/unit/actions/
block_wire_snapshot.json). Everything that is NOT wire — translating the
knobs into backend values and driving scroll → filter → collect → report —
lives here, reading the knobs off `self._block`.

`PipelineRun`/`ScrollCallbacks` stay defined in `actions.scroll_parse`:
they are golden-visible names (the AREA-D snapshot records their owning
module, and three delegate annotations quote their dotted path), so this
module imports them instead of owning them. The block imports
`ScrollRunPart` lazily inside `__init__` — the house cycle-breaker (same
shape as the G7 §3 `_Parts` bundle).
