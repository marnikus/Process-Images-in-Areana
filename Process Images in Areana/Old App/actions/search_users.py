"""Search Users — type into the users-list Поиск search box (verified).

The users list (Virt-Chat) has its own search field above the virtual
viewport: `.search-field input[matinput]`. "Поиск" is a floating mat-label
(no placeholder) and the #mat-input-N ids change on every mount, so the
block locates the field structurally and types with the same verified
chain as Type Message — PLUS it proves the field was really clicked (the
cursor is inside: document.activeElement === the field, with a real click
issued first when needed) and that the text really landed (value read-back).
