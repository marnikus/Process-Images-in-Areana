"""Pick Person — pick a saved person and remember its nick for {{nick}}.

A driver-style block (like Repeat Loop / Conditional Skip): it performs no
per-user action and never clicks anything. Once per run cycle the engine
asks it to choose one person from the People list by the configured rule
and remembers the nick (engine.note_selected) — every later block field
that contains {{nick}} resolves to it.

Rules (radio buttons in the UI):
  * random_new   — any RANDOM person with Status New (un-messaged);
  * random_done  — any RANDOM person with Status Done (already messaged);
  * order_first  — exactly the person with Order (#) = 1 (the first person
                   the run would process; queue_order()[0]).

When the chosen rule has no matching person, choose() returns None and the
engine warns + skips, leaving any previous selection untouched.
