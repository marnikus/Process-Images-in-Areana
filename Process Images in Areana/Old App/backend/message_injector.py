"""Message injection into Virt-Chat textarea via CDP (with debugger detail).

Both helpers accept an optional `report(message, level)` callback so the
engine can stream step-by-step results (element search → found/failed →
clickable → action outcome) into the UI log console and run trace.

type_message() uses a verified fallback chain. Some pages (and some message
content) reject a programmatic .value write, so when the first strategy
does not verify the text is instead copied to the clipboard and pasted with
a real Ctrl+V into the focused field, and if the clipboard is unavailable
it is inserted through CDP's Input.insertText.

Family map (Round G3, RULE 18): this seam owns the two public entries
(type_message, type_search) and re-exports the family's public surface.
Field discovery and the field JS payloads live in
`backend.message_injector_field`, the verified typing ladder in
`backend.message_injector_type`, the send-button family in
`backend.message_injector_send`. One-way imports: seam → siblings,
type/send → field; every public name stays reachable here unchanged.
