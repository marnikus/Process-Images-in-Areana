"""Reading a conversation without re-reading it.

`ChatParser` is the Python side of the in-page agent: a state probe, a range
probe and a drain probe, plus the two-step private-chat gate. `sync_conversation()`
is the algorithm that turns those three into "append only what is new" — it is a
façade over `backend.chat_sync`, which owns the phases (plan → read → align →
persist). This module stays the import site for all of it, so no caller changed
(design doc §3.1).

    state()                     one cheap probe
      │  nothing changed        → done, ZERO node reads
      │  head unchanged, longer → read [dom_count, count)      (delta)
      └─ anything else          → read the visible range and let the
                                  archive align it, backfilling anything
                                  that appeared ABOVE what we stored

Chunked reads are paced and interruptible, so a 3000-message bootstrap never
blocks the UI and stops promptly when the user says stop (RULE 7).
