"""Chrome DevTools Protocol WebSocket client with auto-reconnect.

Round H step H-B6 split the file by *who it talks to*:

* `backend/cdp_client_transport.py` — the wire: the connect/disconnect
  lifecycle, request/response framing, the receive loop, tab discovery and
  the command helpers (script injection, cookies, input, file inputs);
* `backend/cdp_client_events.py` — the event fan-out: the listener table
  and the isolation rule (a failing listener must never kill the loop);
* this file — the `CDPClient` QObject the rest of the application knows,
  plus the priority lease and `TabInfo`.

The facade keeps every historical name and seam: the mutable socket state
(`_ws`, `_cmd_id`, `_pending`, `_connected`, `_receive_task`) stays plain
instance attributes, and every command method calls `self.send`, so the
long-standing test seam (shadowing `cdp.send` with a fake, assigning
`cdp._ws` / `cdp._connected`) works unchanged (tests/test_cdp_events.py,
tests/unit/backend/test_cdp_client_transport.py). `CdpLease` and `TabInfo`
stay defined here because the public API snapshot pins them to this module
(tests/unit/backend/backend_api_snapshot.json).

Imports: the two part modules only (plus PySide6); the parts never import
this file back.
