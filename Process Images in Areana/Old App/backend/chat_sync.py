"""The conversation-sync algorithm, in phases — the family seam.

`backend.chat_parser` owns the *probes* (one state probe, one range probe, one
drain) and the private-chat gate. This family owns the *decision*: what to
read given what the archive already holds, and what to write back.

    run_sync(parser, repo, nick, options)                    ← this file
      ├─ SyncSession.prepare()   probe → install → gate → viewport → cursor
      ├─ SyncPlanner.plan()      (state, cursor, options) → ReadPlan   [pure]
      ├─ ChunkReader.read()      paced, retrying, stop-aware range reads
      ├─ DeltaAligner.apply()    what appeared ABOVE what we stored
      ├─ SyncPersister.*         every repo.write, in one place
      └─ SyncSession.finish()    final cursor, totals, reason

Family map (import direction is one-way down the list, and nothing in the
family imports this seam, so it cannot close a cycle — the F1 `db_deletion_*`
pattern):

    chat_sync_options   SyncOptions — the eleven knobs of one sync
    chat_sync_plan      MODE_*, ReadPlan, SyncPlanner — the pure decision
    chat_sync_persist   merge_live, SyncPersister — every archive write
    chat_sync_read      SLICE_RETRIES, ChunkReader, DeltaAligner
    chat_sync_session   SyncViewport, SyncSession — the shared run state

The split is internal: `backend.chat_parser.sync_conversation()` is the
public entry point and delegates here. Since Round G step 4 it takes the
knobs as one typed `SyncOptions` (it used to gather 11 keyword arguments
into one itself); `services/collector_service` and the `COLLECT_HISTORY`
block build the object at the call site. Every public name this module
owned before the split is re-exported below, so existing import sites —
`chat_parser`'s seam, the phase tests, the plan tests — are unchanged.

Why the phases are objects and not functions: they share one mutable
`SyncSession` (the page state can change *during* a read — a virtualised pane
that loses its nodes mid-read updates the count and the signatures, and the
final cursor write must reflect what was actually read, not what we hoped for).

History: this file was 807 lines (MI 11.35, the worst in the repo) until the
AREA D freeze was lifted by owner ruling on 2026-09-13 and Round G step G2
split it into this family:
