"""RULE 16 gate — size and complexity limits, measured rather than asserted.

One implementation, three callers: a human reading the report, the pre-commit
hook, and `tests/test_rule16_new_code.py`. Keeping the policy tables here
instead of in the test is what stops the two from drifting apart and giving
different answers about the same code.

# Pre-existing oversized classes this feature cannot split — the AREA D API
# snapshot forbids removing `HistoryQuery` methods and the QWebChannel wire
# contract pins `HistoryBridge`'s slot set. Frozen at the 3820136 measurement:
# they may shrink, they may not grow.
#
# `HistoryBridge` re-frozen at 467/44 (was 493/45) after the boot-wait fix
# moved `_run_async`'s guard into `services.world_events.run_when_world_open`.
# The method count drops by one because the gate counts nested defs through
# `ast.walk`, and the inner `async def guarded()` is gone: 26 LOC and one
# method of real shrink, locked here so it cannot be handed back.
# Round H step H-B1 (`2026-09-14`, AREA_B_BACKEND_BRIDGE_DESIGN §3) then moved
# the twenty-one @Slot bodies into the four `history_bridge_*` part modules:
# 467 LOC / 44 -> 180 LOC / 27 methods — the seven Signals and the twenty-one
# @Slots the QWebChannel wire pins, plus the guarded runner (`_run_async` /
# `_schedule`), `_json_arg`, `_ask` and `_run_if_archive`. Re-frozen at the
# measured 180/27: the slots cannot shrink (the frontend calls every one of
# them by name), so the LOC axis is where the split's gain lives.
# `HistoryQuery` was re-frozen at 362/14 by the sortable-columns feature; Round
# H step H-B2 moved the FTS/LIKE back-end into `backend/history_query_search.py`
# (`search` + `_fts_query` / `_like_escape` / `_snippet`), which took the class
# to the measured 266/14. Re-frozen there — the remaining half of H-B2 (the row
# projection) can still shrink it, but nothing may hand the 96 LOC back.
# H-B2b (2026-09-15) moved PersonPageRequest to `history_query_request.py`
# (51 LOC) and row projection to `history_query_projection.py` (93 LOC),
# taking HistoryQuery facade from 266/14 → 179/13 (measured). Re-frozen at
# 179/13 — the projection is pure mapping, the request is value object.
# `ScrollRunPart` is the G7.5 run-pipeline half of the monolithic
# ScrollParse: 12 methods, 197 LOC of SPAN — the size its split ledger
# documents, shipped while the file sat outside the OWNED scan. The Speed
# port (2026-09-13) registers the file here, so the class becomes gated;
# it is frozen at exactly that size — the port's `_with_run_speed` helper
# is module-level and the call site is net-zero lines, deliberately, so the
# ratchet could not be handed any growth.

# they may disappear, they may not be joined by new ones.
#
# One of these touches an owned file — ('bridge/db_bridge.py',
# 'bridge/history_bridge.py'). It is the standard import header (from
# __future__ / json / logging / os / PySide6.QtCore), present since the base
# commit 3820136, i.e. it predates this feature. Verified with
# `git log -L 8,15:bridge/history_bridge.py`.
#
# Maintenance 2026-09-11 (DB undo/restore): the AREA C sized split removed two
# of these outright — ('app/lifecycle.py', 'services/history/export.py') and
# ('services/history/mutate.py', 'services/undo_service.py') no longer share a
# window (export.py gained one import, UndoService shed the commit/scheduling
# code). One new group appeared and is the same kind of noise:
# ('services/history/query.py', 'services/undo_service.py') is the plain
# `from __future__ / copy / json / logging / os` header — undo_service no
# longer imports asyncio (the task plumbing moved to undo_timeline.py), which
# left those two files with the identical 6-line header. No logic is copied.
#
# Maintenance 2026-09-12 (Round F, step F1): splitting `services/db_deletion.py`
# (665 lines) into the `db_deletion_*` family added one group of the same kind —
# ('services/db_deletion_inventory.py', 'services/db_deletion_policy.py') share
# the 6-line header `from __future__ / os / dataclasses(dataclass, field) /
# from services import db_deletion_paths as _paths`. Both modules genuinely need
# exactly those four imports, and the shared `_paths` alias is not incidental:
# it is what keeps `canonical()` patchable at one place now that its callers
# live in five files (see the note in tests/integration/safety_deletion/
# test_deletion_defensive.py). No logic is copied.
# Tried and rejected as fixes: a module constant between the imports and the
# code does NOT dissolve the group, because the scanner hashes every
# *consecutive* statement window and the four imports remain one; and dropping
# the blank line between import groups would hide the group by shrinking its
# span below MIN_SPAN, which is gaming the scanner (§18.5), not fixing it.
#
# Maintenance 2026-09-12 (Round F, step F2): decomposing `Collector`
# (526 class LOC / 40 methods) into the `services/collector_*` family removed
# one group and added one, so the count is unchanged at 12. Both halves are
# recorded because they were verified separately, not assumed.
#
# REMOVED — ('bridge/stack_bridge.py', 'services/collector_service.py'). Same
# header noise as the others: both opened
# `from __future__ / asyncio / json / logging / datetime`. Moving the payload
# shaping into services/collector_report.py left collector_service.py with no
# `json` use at all, so the dead import was deleted and the header shrank to
# four statements. The ratchet working as intended, not a scanner dodge: the
# import genuinely went unused (pylint W0611 flagged it).
#
# ADDED — ('services/collector_partner.py', 'services/collector_report.py'),
# span 6 at line 9 in both: `from __future__ import annotations` / `import
# json` / `import logging` / `from typing import Optional`. This one only
# appeared once the two modules were given PEP8-grouped imports (pylint C0411
# failed on the alphabetical-by-text order the generator first emitted), which
# is the honest order and the one every other module here uses. No logic is
# copied. Each of the four names is genuinely used in BOTH files — `json.dumps`
# for the emitted payloads, `log.debug` in the emit-failure handlers, `Optional`
# in the `nick` parameter — and vulture at confidence 90 reports no dead code in
# either module, so there is no unused import to delete that would dissolve the
# window. Tried and rejected: reordering the imports back to dissolve the group
# would reintroduce C0411 and is exactly the cosmetic span-shrinking §18.5
# forbids. This is the same situation as the F1 pair
# ('services/db_deletion_inventory.py', 'services/db_deletion_policy.py')
# directly below.
#
# ── Round F step F3 (UndoService → the undo_* family) ────────────────
#
# DISSOLVED — ('services/history/query.py', 'services/undo_service.py').
# undo_service.py went from 573 lines to 248 and its import header went with
# the code that used it: `json`, `os` and `logging` all left for
# undo_apply.py / undo_world.py, so the shared window no longer exists. The
# gate reported it stale and it is deleted here — the ratchet working down
# rather than rotting into fiction.
#
# ADDED — ('services/history/query.py', 'services/undo_world.py'), span 6 at
# query.py:1 and undo_world.py:17: `from __future__ import annotations` /
# `import copy` / `import json` / `import logging` / `import os`, with
# `log = logging.getLogger("chatbot")` immediately below in both. No logic is
# copied — it is the standard header of a leaf service module. Every name is
# genuinely used in undo_world.py: `copy.deepcopy` in sync_world_state,
# `json.dumps` in emit_db_change, `logging` for the module logger,
# `os.path.abspath` / `os.path.basename` in restart_world, and `annotations`
# for the `Result[None]` / `list[dict]` hints. vulture reports NOTHING in
# undo_world.py at any confidence, so there is no unused import whose removal
# would dissolve the window honestly. Tried and rejected: reordering or
# splitting the imports to break the span is exactly the cosmetic
# span-shrinking §18.5 forbids, and would reintroduce pylint C0411. Same
# situation as the F1 pair below and the two F2 pairs above.
#
# ── Round G step G3 (flow family split, injector family split) ──────
#
# MOVED — ('backend/media_handler.py', 'backend/message_injector.py') is
# now ('backend/media_handler.py', 'backend/message_injector_field.py'),
# span 7 at media_handler.py:118 and message_injector_field.py:68. The
# cloned content is the byte-identical `_rep` reporter helper (the
# report-callback with the logging fallback), which the injector split
# moved into the field module verbatim. The debt is unchanged in kind and
# count — media_handler still carries its own copy — so the baseline key
# follows the move instead of pretending the debt dissolved. Deduping
# `_rep` into one shared reporter module is a real refactor beyond this
# structural step; recorded as Round G backlog (plan §4, G7).
#
# ADDED — ('services/db_deletion_flow_remove.py',
# 'services/db_deletion_scan.py'), span 7 at flow_remove.py:10 and
# scan.py:13: the deletion family's standard header (`from __future__` /
# asyncio / logging / os / `from services import db_deletion` /
# db_media_scan / the module `log`). No logic is copied. Every name is
# genuinely used in flow_remove.py: asyncio for the three CancelledError
# re-raises, logging for the three log.debug failure lines, os throughout
# the unlink/prune phases, db_deletion for canonical /
# build_deletion_inventory / prune_empty_dirs / is_within,
# DB_GROUP_SUFFIXES in _remove_database_group, scan_world_media in
# _rescan_keep. vulture at confidence 90 reports nothing in the file, so
# there is no unused import whose removal would dissolve the window
# honestly. Tried and rejected: reordering or splitting the imports to
# break the span is the cosmetic span-shrinking §18.5 forbids and would
# reintroduce C0411. Same situation as the F1 pair
# ('services/db_deletion_inventory.py', 'services/db_deletion_policy.py').
# Maintenance 2026-09-13 (Round G, step G4): two entries change.
#
# REMOVED — ('services/run/__init__.py', 'services/run_service/__init__.py').
# W6 extended the lazy __getattr__ re-exports of services/run/__init__.py with
# RunDeps/StepContext, which broke the shared import/__all__ header window the
# group was frozen on; clone_scan no longer reports it, so the baseline
# ratchets down by one.
#
# ADDED — ('bridge/context.py', 'services/wiring_requests.py'). Same header
# noise as the others: W7 turned BridgeContext into a dataclass and the W5
# bundle module opens with the identical four statements — __future__,
# dataclass, typing (Any, Optional), core.events.EventBus. Both genuinely
# need exactly those imports (each annotates Optional[EventBus] fields and
# Any-typed collaborators); no logic is copied. A click_user|scroll_parse
# group W8 briefly created was dissolved instead of recorded — NewTabCheck
# .before is Optional[dict] (the annotation _verify_new_tab always had), so
# click_user does not import Any and the shared window stays under MIN_SPAN.
# Maintenance 2026-09-13 (AI Bot Chat): `bridge/bot_bridge.py` joined the
# existing ('bridge/cdp_bridge.py', 'bridge/people_bridge.py') group, which
# grows to three files. It is the same standard bridge header the other groups
# here are — `from __future__ / asyncio / json / logging / PySide6.QtCore
# (QObject, Signal, Slot) / from core.events import …` — and no logic is
# copied. Every name is genuinely used in bot_bridge.py: `asyncio.ensure_future`
# schedules the Grok call, `json.dumps` shapes every answer, `log.warning`
# reports a raising service, the three Qt names declare the slots and signals,
# and `LogMessage` puts a failure in the log console. Tried and rejected:
# dropping or reordering an import to dissolve the window would either delete a
# used name or reintroduce pylint C0411 — the cosmetic span-shrinking §18.5
# forbids.
# Maintenance 2026-09-14 (Round H, Area C step H-C1): one entry DISSOLVED —
# ('services/run/coordinator.py', 'services/run/progress.py'). The cloned
# window was the `try: from stores.user_memory import UserRecord / except
# Exception: @dataclass class UserRecord …` import guard, which coordinator.py
# and progress.py each carried a byte-identical copy of. H-C1 splits the run
# ladder's queue half out of progress.py, and the guard now exists once, in
# services/run/requests.py (the module that already owns the run family's
# value objects); progress.py re-exports the name so the P0-2 runtime pin
# still holds. Nothing was added to reach this: the group is simply gone.
# Maintenance 2026-09-15 (H-B2b + H-C5): two entries change.
#
# DISSOLVED — ('services/history/query.py', 'services/undo_world.py',
# 'stores/preset_store.py'). query.py went from 174 → 109 + 77 (settings
# split), so its import header no longer matches undo_world/preset_store.
# The shared window is now only between undo_world and preset_store.
#
# ADDED — ('services/collector_archive.py', 'services/collector_probe.py'),
# span 6 at archive.py:9 and probe.py:9: the collector family's standard
# header (from __future__ / logging / dataclasses / typing Optional /
# CollectorState). No logic copied, same pattern as other collector pairs.
