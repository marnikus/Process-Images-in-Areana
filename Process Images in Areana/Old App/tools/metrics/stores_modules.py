"""RULE 18 §18.3 gate — how many MODULES `stores/` really has.

§18.3 caps a directory at ~15 cohesive files and offers two remedies past it:
promote a family to a sub-package, or treat a prefix family as one module —
"a family is a module in everything but the directory separator; treat it as
one when counting."

`stores/` holds 37 Python files, so the raw count reads as two and a half times
over the ceiling. This measures the count the rule actually asks for, and checks
that the grouping is real rather than convenient: every group has to justify
itself from the import graph, and every module has to belong to exactly one
group, so a new loose file fails the gate until someone says where it belongs.

The sub-package remedy is NOT available to `stores/`, and the reason is a
contract rather than effort. `tests/unit/stores/test_stores_public_api.py`
fails on "any change at all" to the frozen surface recorded in
`api_baseline.json`, whose keys are dotted module paths, and plan §7.3 rule 1
forbids renames or moves of any symbol another area imports. Moving
`stores/history_*.py` into `stores/history/` was tried on branch
`arena/01a09a61-chat-v-bot` and failed five tests, including
`test_the_three_frozen_modules_did_not_move_at_all`. Merging files is blocked
too: it would undo the deliberate AREA B2 splits (`user_query`,
`preset_migration` are named in `test_stores_structure.py::SPLIT_FILES` as
collaborators that belong behind their facade) and every candidate pair lands
outside §18.2's 150-300 line band (`user_memory` 284 + `user_query` 83 = 367,
`preset_store` 221 + `preset_migration` 84 = 305, `atomic` 151 +
`json_store` 159 = 310).

So this is the counting remedy, measured. Round F step F8,
`docs/archive/2026-09-12-round-f-size-tail/ROUND_F_DESIGN_2026-09-12.md` §11.

Exits 0 when the effective module count fits the ratchet and every group's
