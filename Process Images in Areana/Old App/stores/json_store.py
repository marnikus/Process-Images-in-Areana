"""`JsonFileStore` — the one lifecycle every config-file store shares.

Design ref: docs/archive/2026-09-09-four-area-refactor/REFACTOR_2026-09-09_AREA_B_DESIGN.md §1.1 (plan P1-3).

Seven stores in this package each own one small JSON file, and each had grown
its own dialect of the same three operations: two constructor spellings
(`path` for `ConfigManager`, `AtomicJsonStore` for the store tests — so
`SessionStore(atomic)` died with a `TypeError`), three names for "persist"
(`save`, `flush`, or none at all), and `save()` returning a `Result` in one
file and a `bool` in another. `backend/config_manager.py` had to remember
which store spoke which dialect. This base is that memory, written down once:

  * **construction** — `Store(atomic | path, *, data=None)`; the payload of a
    borrowed `AtomicJsonStore` is deliberately re-read from disk, because the
    *file* is the contract, not the object;
  * **state** — the live payload is `self._data` (a subclass owns its
    projections of it), and every read hands out a deep copy;
  * **`load()` / `reload()`** — read from disk, clear `dirty`;
  * **`save(force=False)` / `flush()`** — a `bool` answering "does the file
    match memory now?"; `SAVE_ALWAYS` stores (the two that used to write
    inside every mutation) persist unconditionally, the overlay stores only
    when they are dirty or `force` is set.

A store adds its own API on top and overrides `_coerce` to normalise what it
read. It must not override `save`/`flush`/`load`: that is the whole point.
