"""Outcome / Refusal — a `Result` whose truthiness means "something changed".

Design ref: docs/archive/2026-09-09-four-area-refactor/REFACTOR_2026-09-09_AREA_B_DESIGN.md §1.2.

`core/result.py` is frozen for every area, and it deliberately has no
__bool__: `Ok(None)` and `Err("…")` are both truthy there. Two callers of the
bookmark store ask a question that a plain `Ok` cannot answer:

    bridge/cdp_bridge.py:87   if self.ctx.config.bookmarks.add(url):   # toast
    stores/bookmark_store.py  add/remove → "did the list change?"

`BookmarkStoreProto` in `core/interfaces.py` documents the return as `bool`,
so the *truthiness* is the contract and the `Result` is the extra detail.
`Outcome`/`Refusal` are the two narrow subclasses that make both readings true
at once — a store can keep its `-> Result[...]` annotation while `if …:`
means what the proto says.

Nothing outside `stores/` imports this module; it exists so the config stores
have one vocabulary for "accepted / refused / no-op".

    code that only asks "did anything happen?".
