"""TimelineCommit — writing the ONE global undo timeline (AREA C split).

`services/undo_service.py` keeps the timeline state machine (push / undo /
redo / projections); this collaborator owns what happens when the timeline
is written:

* `commit` stamps the entry identity (`seq`), splits the ONE line by
  ownership (app half → `config/undo.json`, world half → the active world's
  `undo_history` table) and erases the rows whose undo step just left it;
* `spawn` runs the async half of a step (the trash purge, an archive
  command) and logs a task that dies — a task that dies silently is what let
  a locked world keep a person deleted while the log said “archive restored”
  (bug 2026-09-11).

The timeline POINTER and the failure rewind (`rewind_after_failure`) stay on
`UndoService`, which owns the state machine; no `rewind` lives here.

Imports point down only: stdlib, `core.events` and nothing that imports this
file (the host is duck-typed, like `services/undo_support.py` does it).
