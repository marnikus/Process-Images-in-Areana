"""Undo collaborators extracted from `services/undo_service.py` (AREA C).

`UndoProjection` holds the PURE timeline reads — migrating the stored
`undo_history`, migrating the legacy `stack_history`/`grid_layout_history`/
`grid_layout` config, clamping the pointer, and projecting per-kind views.
No I/O, no config writes: every caller that needs to persist a projection
does it through `UndoService` (the host), exactly as before.

`UndoWorldStore` holds the WORLD-bound half of the ONE global timeline —
the active world's `undo_history` table. The app-bound half stays in
`config/undo.json` and is written by the host's `ConfigManager`. Pending
save tasks live on the HOST (`host._undo_pendings`) so the existing
tests that read `UndoService._undo_pendings` keep working unchanged.

        Two saves used to be allowed in flight at once (`_undo_pendings` is a
        list, and a push during a switch schedules a second save before the
        first lands). That was two bugs on one connection:

        * `save_world_undo` is DELETE-all-then-INSERT-all, so overlapping
          saves interleave and can leave the table holding half of one
          timeline and half of another — a data race no gate can fix, and the
          reason the queueing below stays even though the second bug is gone;
        * the connection's `WriteTurn` tracked "held" with ONE flag, so the
          first save's commit cleared it while the second was still between
          its statements; the second re-entered the world gate (depth 1 -> 2)
          and its own commit only decremented once, leaving the writer turn
          held for good by a closed connection. Every later writer then
          waited WAIT_S (15s) and failed OPEN — the exact bug class the gate
          was added for (2026-09-11: a Ctrl+Z reported success while the
          person stayed deleted). The flag itself was fixed as residual risk
          F3c: `WriteTurn` now holds the gate for the union of its writer
          tasks (docs/archive/2026-09-13-round-g-write-gate/ROUND_G_DESIGN_2026-09-13.md §5).

        So a save requested while one is running is queued instead of started;
        the running task picks the newest queue up before it finishes. There is
        no await between that check and the task ending, so nothing can be
        queued into a gap. `settle()` still waits for the queued write because
