"""Deletion plan / inventory / path policy / bounded helpers (AREA A).

Public face of the `db_deletion_*` family. The implementation lives in the five
siblings below; this file re-exports it so that both existing import styles keep
working unchanged — `from services.db_deletion import ...` and the
`db_deletion.<name>` attribute access used by `db_deletion_scan` and
`db_registry`.

    db_deletion_paths       canonical(), is_within(), is_same_file()
    db_deletion_inventory   what exists on disk
    db_deletion_plan        what a deletion would touch
    db_deletion_policy      what is safe to unlink
    db_deletion_exec        bounded unlink / rmdir, and DeletionOutcome

Import direction is one-way down that list, and nothing in the family imports
this shim, so it cannot close a cycle. No framework, no generic transaction
abstraction, no new dependency.
