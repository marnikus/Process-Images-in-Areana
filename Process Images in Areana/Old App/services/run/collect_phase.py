"""The Scroll & Parse phase of a run cycle (AREA C, split 2026-09-11).

Extracted from `services/run/error_recovery.py` so `RunExecutionMixin` stays
inside the RULE 16 method cap and this file stays inside the RULE 18 file
band: collecting people is its own responsibility — run the pipeline under
the retry policy, persist who survived the filter, summarise the outcome in
one line, and answer the stop question at the phase boundary.

The mixin is internal (every method is private) and reaches the engine the
same way `RunExecutionMixin` does: through `RunCoordinator`'s bases, so
`engine._run_collect_phase(...)` keeps resolving by MRO.
