"""The archive half of an undo entry — apply it, prove it, report it.

`services/undo_service.py` owns WHEN a command runs (the ONE global
timeline); this collaborator owns HOW: it applies both halves of an archive
entry (the People-list snapshot and the archive rows), reads the world back
and reports only what the rows now show.

It exists because of the bug of 2026-09-11. The old
`UndoService._apply_archive_command` *scheduled* its work and returned True,
so when the database answered `database is locked` the timeline moved, the
log said “↩ Undo — archive restored”, and the person stayed deleted forever —
the scheduled coroutine's exception had nowhere to go. An archive command is
now ONE task that must prove itself before it is allowed to say anything:

* **Who first, then the rows.** The People-list snapshot is applied before
  the archive write; if the archive half fails, the list half is put back, so
  the queue and the database can never disagree about who exists (RULE 14).
* **Read back before speaking.** The outcome line and the change event are
  built from `HistoryQuery.person_stats` *after* the write, never from the
  intent. An archive that is not running is the one case that reports
  “People list only”, because that is the truth.
* **A refusal is loud.** No success words, an ERROR line the user can see, a
  `UserDbChanged(action="failed")` so the list reloads from the truth, and
  the timeline pointer is put back so the next Ctrl+Z retries the entry.

Direction: `services/` → `stores/` (the write gate). No Qt, no `bridge.*`.
