## 1. Install Python Dependencies

Make sure you have **Python 3.11+** installed, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:
| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| PySide6 | Qt6 GUI framework (window, web view, web channel) |
| websockets | WebSocket client for Chrome DevTools Protocol |
| aiohttp | HTTP client for Chrome tab discovery |
| aiosqlite | Async SQLite for user memory storage |
| qasync | Bridges Qt event loop with Python asyncio |

---

## 2. Start Chrome with Remote Debugging

You **must** launch Chrome with the remote debugging port flag:

**Windows — recommended (dedicated profile):**
```cmd
"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\chatflow-chrome"
```

`--user-data-dir` starts Chrome on a **separate profile** kept in
`C:\chatflow-chrome`. That is the reliable way to do this:

* it works even when your everyday Chrome is already open — a normal Chrome
  without the flag simply hands the command over to the running instance and
  the debug port never opens;
* your normal profile, cookies, extensions and open tabs are untouched;
* the first launch is a brand-new profile, so log in to the chat once inside
  that window; the login is remembered in `C:\chatflow-chrome` for every
  later launch.

That exact command ships with the repo as **`start-chatflow-chrome.bat`** —
double-click it (or make a shortcut to it) so Chrome always starts the same
way. It also opens the chat page for you.

**Windows — plain (uses your normal profile):**
```cmd
"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

**macOS:**
```bash
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="$HOME/chatflow-chrome"
```

**Linux:**
```bash
google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="$HOME/chatflow-chrome"
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** without `--user-data-dir`, close ALL Chrome windows before
> running the command. If Chrome is already running without the debug flag,
> the flag is ignored and the app won't be able to connect. With
> `--user-data-dir` you can skip that — the dedicated profile always opens its
> own instance and its own debug port.
>
> Check it worked: open **http://localhost:9222/json/version** in any browser.
> A JSON page means the port is live; "connection refused" means Chrome was
> started without the flag (or the old instance swallowed the command).

In that Chrome window, open **https://ru.virt-chat.com/chat** and log in.

---

## 3. Run the App

```bash
python main.py
```

The app window will open and **automatically detect** your open Chrome tabs.

---

## 4. Connect to Chrome Tab

1. In the app header, find the **dropdown** on the right side
2. Select the **virt-chat.com** tab from the list (click 🔄 refresh if it's empty)
3. Click the **🔗 Connect** button
4. The status dot should turn **green** 🟢 — you're connected!

---

## 5. Using the App

### Build an Action Stack
Add blocks from the **+ Add** menu, or click them to add:
- **Find & Click** — configurable search-and-click block (see below)
- **Click Main Tab** — switch to a chat room tab
- **Scroll Parse** — scroll through the user list and collect users
- **Click User** — click on a specific user to open private chat
- **Wait Page Load** — wait for a page/element to appear
- **Type Message** — type a message (supports `{{nick}}` variable)
- **Click Send** — click the send button
- **Attach Image** — attach an image file
- **Click Back** — return to the main chat list
- **Pause** — add a delay between actions
- **Conditional Skip** — skip users already messaged

### Find & Click — the configurable action-block constructor
A generic search-and-click block that is built entirely in the UI — it is the
way to create your own reusable blocks instead of being limited to the
hardcoded ones. Example: a "Find Settings Button" block.

**The two search fields (CSS selectors):**
- **① Element to find — the clickable box**, e.g. `div[role='tab'].tab-item`
  (the button/rectangle to detect).
- **② Separate text element inside it to confirm**, e.g. `p.chat-title`
  (a *different* element whose text proves this is the right box), plus an
  optional **text to match** (e.g. `Settings`; empty = take the first match).

**Click or not:**
- **Click after found** ticks the box and clicks the found element when the
  match is confirmed.
- **Or click this inner element instead** (CSS, optional) clicks a child of
  the found box rather than the box itself.
- Untick **Click after found** to turn the block into a find/verify-only step.

**Build once, reuse everywhere:**
1. **+ Add** → **🔎 Find & Click**, click the new card to open its config panel.
2. Give it a **custom name** (e.g. `Find Settings Button`) — shown on the card
   and in the run logs.
3. Fill in the two search fields, the text to match, and the click behaviour.
4. Press **Save as new preset** — the block is stored in the single
   `config.json` store and appears as a chip under **Custom blocks** and at the
   top of the **+ Add** menu.
5. Reuse it in any stack by clicking the chip (or its **+ Add** entry) — the
   full configuration comes back. If you edit a saved block and press the
   button again it reads **Update preset “name”** and overwrites that preset.
6. Remove a preset you no longer need with the **×** on its chip (confirmed in
   an in-app dialog). Everything persists across app restarts.

**Keep the config open while you work:** click the 📌 **pin** button in the
Block Config title bar. While pinned, the panel stays open even when no block
is selected (it shows the empty-state hint until you pick one). Click 📌 again
to unpin and restore the default close-on-deselect behaviour; the **×** close
button always closes and unpins. The pin state is remembered across app
restarts, so the panel reopens when you come back.

### Reorder Blocks (drag & drop)
Grab any block (or its **⠿** handle) and drag it up or down. While you move
the mouse you get full visual feedback:
- the dragged block **lifts off** into a floating, tilted card that follows the
  cursor, and its old position turns into a dashed, pulsing **drop slot**
- the other blocks **slide apart** to open the gap
- a **glowing insertion bar** marks exactly the position the block will take if
  you release right now, and a badge next to the cursor shows `3 → 5`
- releasing drops the block there and it **flashes** so you can see where it landed
- the list **auto-scrolls** when you drag near the top/bottom edge
- press **Esc** during a drag to cancel it; nothing is changed
- keyboard alternative: select a block and press **Alt+↑ / Alt+↓**

The reorder engine is bundled with the app (`ui/js/stack-drag.js`) and needs no
internet connection. Reorders are saved to the session snapshot like any other
stack edit.

### Flexible Grid Layout (drag any window anywhere)
Every content window — **Stats, Filters, Action Stack, Block Config,
Message Composer, User Memory, Log Console** — is a draggable tile in a
free-form grid. The top menu bar (app header + URL/Language/Presets toolbar)
stays pinned; everything below it is rearrangeable.

- **Move** — grab a window by its **title bar** (⠿ grip) and drag it:
  - drop on an **edge** of a window → that window **splits in half** and you
    land in the new half (e.g. Composer left | People right)
  - drop on a window's **centre** → you **join its row/column** (the two
    windows share its former space)
  - drop on a **separator (sash)** → you are inserted between the two
    neighbours
  - a glowing line shows exactly where the split/insertion will land, a badge
    next to the cursor names the outcome, **Esc** cancels
- **Resize** — drag any sash; the two neighbours trade space while the rest of
  the grid **adapts proportionally** (structure is never broken). Double-click
  a sash to reset that split to even sizes.
- **Span** — a window next to a group of windows automatically spans their
  full height/width (e.g. the Log Console as a tall side column).
- **Preset layouts** — the **▦ Layouts** button in the header applies ready
  arrangements in one click: **Default**, **A** (stacked rows), **B**
  (Composer | People side by side, Log below) and **C** (Log as full-height
  side column). Your manual arrangement always wins until the next preset.
- The arrangement **persists** across app restarts (validated on load — a
  corrupted layout can never brick the UI).
- Every panel/row has a usable minimum width and height; resizing cannot make
  a neighboring row disappear.
- Grid edits use the same global `Undo` / `Redo` controls and `Ctrl+Z` /
  `Ctrl+Y` history as action-stack edits. There is no second grid history.

Implementation: `ui/js/sash-core.js` (pure split-tree model),
`ui/js/sash-grid.js` (rendering + drag/resize), `ui/css/sash-layout.css`;
design in `docs/archive/2026-09-05-grid-scroll-undo/SASH_LAYOUT_DESIGN_2026-09-05.md`; tests in
`tests/test_sash_core.py` (node) and `tests/test_sash_webengine.py`
(real Qt WebEngine).

### Save / Load Presets (full action stack)
- **💾 Save** — name the preset and the **complete stack** (block order + every
  block setting) is stored in the single preset file `config.json`.
- Every saved preset appears as a small **chip** under "Saved presets" and in
  the **folder picker list** — click either to load it back. Chips survive an
  app restart (close → reopen → click chip → full stack restored).
- **Save Template / Load Template ▾** work the same way for message templates.
- Deletion is confirmed through an in-app dialog (no browser dialogs needed).

### Export / Import Presets (portable `.json` files)
The Action Stack panel has a dedicated, **text-labeled** preset row:
**[ Select Preset ▾ ]  [ Save ]  [ Export ]  [ Import ]** — four
distinct controls (labels are plain text on purpose, so the row stays
visible even when the icon web font cannot load, e.g. offline).
- **Select Preset ▾** — list of every saved preset (name, save date,
  block count); click **Load** to restore its full stack.
- **Save** — name the current stack and it is stored with **every** block
  parameter and order.
- **Export** — writes the **current stack + every custom block** as one
  standalone `.json` file (native save dialog). The Select Preset list has
  an **Export** button per saved preset, and the **⬇ on a Custom Block
  chip** exports that one block.
- **Import** — pick a `.json` preset file: the app first shows a
  **preview** (block list + compatibility warnings: newer app version,
  unknown block type, a Find & Click block without its selector) and only
  then applies. Choose **Replace** (overwrites the current stack; ↩ Undo
  returns to it) or **Merge** (appends the imported blocks and merges the
  imported custom blocks into your library, same name = same block). The
  imported file is also **saved as a named preset**, so it appears in
  Select Preset immediately. The download button on the Custom Blocks row
  imports a single block.
- The file carries `format` / `format_version` / `app_version`, so a file
  made by a newer app is refused with a clear message instead of silently
  losing steps, and invalid files are rejected before anything is applied.
  The file has no absolute paths or local state — copy it to another
  machine or install and import it there.

### Session restore on startup
On every start the app restores the previous session from the same single
`config.json` store:
- the **last bookmark** is selected again (chip highlighted, URL field filled);
- an **auto-connect attempt** is made using that bookmark's URL;
- the **last used stack** (or the last named preset) is loaded into the editor;
- all preset/template/URL/custom-block chips are restored;
- the main window's last X/Y position and width/height are restored exactly;
- the People table's current sort remains active while live user updates arrive.

### URL Presets (auto-connect by URL)
The toolbar below the header holds a **URL field** and quick-connect presets:
1. Paste a URL or keyword (e.g. `https://ru.virt-chat.com/chat`) or click a chip.
2. Click **Auto-Connect** — the app parses the URL, matches it against every
   open Chrome tab (exact URL → path → host → keyword) and **automatically
   selects and connects** to the best match.
3. Press **+** to store the current URL as a new preset chip, **×** on a chip
   to remove it. The last selected bookmark is remembered for next startup.

### Closing the app
Clicking the window close button (X) shuts the whole process down cleanly —
background tasks are cancelled, the Chrome connection is closed and the
terminal prompt returns. A watchdog force-exits after 3 s if anything blocks.

### Message Composer
Type your message in the bottom composer area. Use `{{nick}}` to insert the
user's nickname automatically.

### Manage the People List (User Memory)
The bottom-left panel lists every discovered user and is fully editable:
- **Filter nick…** — type to narrow the list
- **checkbox column** — tick individual rows; the header checkbox selects or
  deselects all *currently visible* (filtered) rows
- **🗑 Delete selected (n)** — deletes only the ticked nicks
- **🗑 Delete** on a row — deletes that single nick
- **✔ Done / ↩ Undo** on a row — flips that user's "messaged" flag
- **Reset Messaged** — marks every user as new again (deletes nobody)
- **Clear All** — removes every user from memory
- Click **Nick, Gender, Reg?, Status, First Seen, or Messaged** headers to sort;
  click the same header again to reverse the order. The `▲▼` arrows show the
  active direction.

The list fills in as soon as the app starts (no need to connect to a Chrome
tab first). Every destructive action asks for confirmation in an in-app dialog
first. Nicks may contain quotes and emoji — row actions are delegated, never
inlined, so they keep working for any nick.

### Set Filters (Criteria)
Click the ✏️ edit button in the Filters sidebar to set criteria:
- **MUST HAVE** — only message users matching these classes (e.g. `registered`)
- **MUST NOT HAVE** — skip users with these classes (e.g. `guest`, `anonymous`)

### Run & Debugger
1. Click **▶ Run** in the stack header
2. The app will parse users → filter by criteria → execute the stack for each user
3. Use **⏸ Pause** (click again to resume) and **⏹ Stop** at any time

The **Log Console** is a live step-by-step debugger for every block:
- element searches: how many nodes matched and whether the element was **found**
  (e.g. `✅ Tab found: "Гостиная"`) or **not** (`❌ Failed to find element: …`
  with a candidate list when available)
- whether the found element was **clickable** (visible / disabled checks) and
  whether the click actually happened
- per-step status (`✓ Step 3 OK (0.42s)` / `✗ Step 3 FAILED …`) and which block
  is currently executing (highlighted green in the stack)
- a JSONL run trace for every run is written to
  `logs/run_trace_<timestamp>.jsonl` (path announced in the console)

### Debugging & logs
- Daily logs: `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.log` (Python logging)
- Per-run trace: `logs/run_trace_<timestamp>.jsonl` (step-by-step JSON records)

## Message History & the Passive Collector

Everything said in a private chat — both directions, text, images and GIFs —
is archived per nick in a second SQLite database (`history.db`, media bytes
in `saved_media/`). The queue database (`chatbot.db`) is untouched by it:
filters and People-list edits never delete archived messages (docs RULE 14).

### My Nick

The pinned header has a **My Nick** field. Set it to the nick *you* are using
in the chat; it is stored in `config.json` (`collector.my_nick`) and written
next to every archived message, so a conversation always shows both sides
even when your nick changes between sessions.

### The archive windows

They are ordinary grid windows — drag, split, merge and resize them like any
other panel (`📐` menu → *Reset to default* brings them all back). Two more
ordinary windows manage the archive itself: **Label Manager** and
**DB Connection** (see *Person labels* and *The database window* below).

| Window | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Person History** | The whole conversation with one person, oldest first, with inline images/GIFs, day separators and gap markers. Click a nick in **User Memory** to open it. Text is selectable; a left click on an image copies it. Search this conversation, or switch to **All people** for a global search grouped per nick. |
| **Full User Database** | Everyone ever archived, merged by nick (never a duplicate), lazily loaded as you scroll, searchable by nick. Clicking a row opens that person. `Preload` sets how many rows are fetched ahead of the scroll. Every column header (**Nick · Msgs · Media · First · Last · My nick**) is a button: click it to sort ▲, click again to reverse ▼. The order is computed by the database over *all* people, not just the loaded page, and it stays for as long as the app runs. |
| **Chat Message Collector** | What the background collector is doing right now: *Collecting*, *Collected*, *No new messages* or *Not in private tab now*, plus the partner, my nick, the archive total and the heartbeat. Pause/resume it, force one pass, or turn media downloads off. |

### Only real private chats are archived (two-step gate)

Before a single line is written to a person's history, both checks must pass:

1. **Only two nicks.** The in-page agent parses *the pane that is on screen*
   and reports the distinct authors it saw. Mine + the partner ⇒ fine; a
   third nick (the main room, a group tab, a pane left over from the chat
   you just closed) ⇒ nothing is saved.
2. **The tab names that person.** The active `.tab-item` must be a private
   tab (`chat-type-icon = user`) whose title names the same nick.

If either check fails the collector says so in the Chat Message Collector
window (*“Not a private chat — Макс__Б writes here too (nothing saved for
Ански)”*) and stores nothing. The live push channel obeys the same gate, so
switching tabs mid-conversation can never file room chatter under a person.

### Where the pictures are saved

```
saved_media/
├─ Anski/                     ← Latin folder name (Ански), `_nick.txt` names the owner
│  ├─ images/2026-09-07_001.png
│  └─ gifs/2026-09-07_001.gif
└─ Horosho_Vse/
   └─ images/2026-09-07_001.jpg
```

One folder per conversation (both directions), `images/` and `gifs/` split,
files named `YYYY-MM-DD_NNN.ext` — short, sorted, and safe to open, copy or
drag anywhere. Person History renders the **saved file**, never the
percent-encoded remote URL, and the toolbar's **📂 Files** button opens that
person's folder in Explorer. A left click on a picture puts the file itself
on the clipboard (plus the path as text), so it can be pasted straight into
a chat. Older flat `media_cache/<sha256>.<ext>` files are moved into the new
tree automatically on the first start.

### How collection works (and why it does not freeze the UI)

A tiny agent is injected into the page. Every heartbeat it returns only a
**fingerprint of the head and tail** of the conversation plus a message
count — never the whole DOM. When nothing changed, the pass costs one
`Runtime.evaluate`; when the tail grew, only the *new* messages are
serialised, in chunks with a pause between them, and appended. If the page
trimmed or re-rendered the conversation, the collector re-syncs by overlap
and records a **gap marker** rather than silently losing lines.

The collector keeps running (throttled) during an Action Stack run, so a
long automation never costs you messages.

### The COLLECT_HISTORY block

Add **🗃 Collect Message History** to a stack to archive the conversation on
screen on demand: `target` (current tab or the selected person), `mode`
(delta / full re-scan), `max_messages`, chunk size and pause, media on/off,
and *fail if empty*. It reports progress as `done/total` and honours Stop.

## Managing the archive — delete, labels, databases

Everything in this chapter is **undoable with the same global ↶ / ↷ buttons**
(Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y) that undo stack edits and layout changes: one history, one
pair of buttons, no per-window undo (docs RULE 12).

### Removing history

Nothing is ever hard-deleted behind your back. A delete hides the rows
(tombstone `deleted_at`, docs RULE 14) and the undo entry puts them back
byte-for-byte.

| Where | Control | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Person History** toolbar | `🧹 Clear chat` | Removes every message of the open conversation, **keeps the person** in the database. |
| **Person History** toolbar | `🗑 Remove person` | Removes the person *and* the whole conversation. |
| **Person History** message | the small `✕` on a message row | Removes that single message. |
| **Full User Database** row | `🧹` / `🗑` | The same two actions for any archived person, straight from the table. |

The People list keeps working the way it did: a person deleted from the
archive is also dropped from the queue table, and the undo restores both
sides together.

### Person labels

Labels are free text tags with a colour, e.g. `Rude`, `VIP`, `Later`. They
live in `config.json` (so they survive restarts) and every change is undoable.

* Labels are drawn as small coloured pills **next to the nick in both the
  People table and the Full User Database table**.
* The `✕` on a pill removes that label **from that person only** — it never
  deletes the label itself.
* One person can carry as many labels as you like.

**Label Manager** (a normal grid window — minimize, maximize, close, drag it
anywhere, it is listed in the `🪟 Windows` menu and remembers its state) has
four sections:

1. **Active Labels** — every label; its `✕` deletes the label *system-wide*
   (and strips it from everyone). This is the only place that can do that.
2. **Create New Label** — a name field, a colour dot that opens the Color
   Picker, and `＋ Add Label`. Empty or duplicate names are refused with a
   message instead of creating junk.
3. **Filter By Labels** — tick labels, then `Include Selected` (green) or
   `Exclude Selected` (red). *Exclusion wins*: a person carrying an excluded
   label is skipped by an Action Stack run even if they also carry an
   included one — so `Rude` can be ignored during auto-messaging. The title
   bar shows the active rule; `Clear` removes it.
4. **Assign To Person** — a `Select Person…` dropdown that automatically
   follows the person you clicked in the People list or the database, the
   label list (labels the person already has are not offered again) and
   `Assign`.

### The Color Picker

A small dark popup (280×320) you can **drag by its title bar**; it remembers
where you left it. Twenty bright presets in a 5×4 grid — Red, Orange, Yellow,
Lime, Green / Teal, Cyan, Sky Blue, Blue, Indigo / Violet, Purple, Magenta,
Pink, Hot Pink / Coral, Amber, Chartreuse, Spring Green, Aqua. The current
colour wears a white ring; picking one closes the popup, so do `Cancel`, the
`✕` and `Esc`.

### The database window

**DB Connection** is also a normal grid window. It shows the connected file,
its measurements and every `*.db` next to it:

| Reading | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Full DB size** | `history.db` on disk, including its `-wal` / `-shm` companions. |
| **Text size** | How many bytes of the messages are actual text. |
| **Images folder** | Size *and* file count of `saved_media/`. |

Buttons: `Load` (connect to another database — the collector is parked and
restarted around the switch), `＋ Create` (a fresh empty database, named
safely, and connect to it), `🗑` (remove a database) and `🧹 Clean DB` (empty
the connected one). **Delete and Clean never unlink anything**: the file is
moved to `db_trash/` first, the path is stored in the undo entry, and Ctrl+Z
brings the database back and reconnects it.

### Settings (config.json)

```jsonc
"history":   { "enabled": true, "db_path": "history.db",
               "media":   { "enabled": true, "max_file_mb": 25,
                            "max_cache_mb": 200, "cache_dir": "saved_media" },
               "preview": { "preload_rows": 40, "page_size": 50,
                            "show_images": true } },
"collector": { "enabled": true, "my_nick": "", "heartbeat_ms": 1500,
               "require_private": true, "download_media": true },
"labels":    { "defs":   [ { "id": "lbl_1", "name": "Rude",
                             "color": "#ff3b30" } ],
               "assign": { "Ангелина": ["lbl_1"] },
               "filter": { "include": [], "exclude": ["lbl_1"] },
               "next_id": 1 },
"state":     { "db_recent": ["history.db", "archive_2026.db"] }
```

`max_file_mb` is the per-file cap of the media cache. Before 2026-09-07 it
defaulted to 2 MB, which silently `skipped` every ordinary chat GIF — stored
configs carrying a value ≤ 2 are migrated up to 25 on startup
(`docs/archive/2026-09-07-labels-and-collector/BACKFILL_MEDIA_RECOVERY_ROOT_CAUSE_2026-09-07.md`).

## Documentation

* **[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)** — the docs map: what is current vs.
  historical.
* **[`docs/current/SYSTEM_OF_RECORD.md`](docs/current/SYSTEM_OF_RECORD.md)** —
  how the app behaves right now: surfaces, flows (plan → execute, archive write
  path, world deletion), the 16 invariants, storage map, key modules, tests.
* **[`docs/current/AGENT_RULES.md`](docs/current/AGENT_RULES.md)** — the rules
  every code change must obey (behaviour, data, testing, quality gates, docs).
* **[`docs/archive/`](docs/archive/README.md)** — every design/plan/root-cause
  doc ever written here, dated. Historical: read for the *why*, never as spec.
