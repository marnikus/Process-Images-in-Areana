# Docs: start here

This repository has **three current docs** and **105 archived ones**. That is
deliberate: the current set is small enough to keep true, and nothing has been
thrown away.

Also in the repo, not under `docs/`:

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`README.md`](../README.md) | User manual: install, Chrome flags, UI tour |
| [`reports/`](../reports/) | Measured code-quality snapshots (the coverage/complexity **baseline** the rules compare against) |
| `tests/` | The executable spec — 179 Python test files + 31 Node harness files |

## Pick your entry point

| You want to… | Read |
|---|---|
| Know how the app behaves right now | [`current/SYSTEM_OF_RECORD.md`](current/SYSTEM_OF_RECORD.md) |
| Change code and not break a contract | [`current/AGENT_RULES.md`](current/AGENT_RULES.md) — then the matching section of the system of record |
| Touch a DOM probe or selector | [`current/DOM_SELECTORS.md`](current/DOM_SELECTORS.md) |
| Understand *why* something is the way it is | [`archive/README.md`](archive/README.md), or the "history of X" table at the bottom of the system of record |
| Install and drive the app | [`../README.md`](../README.md) |

**Conflict rule:** if an archived doc disagrees with
[`current/SYSTEM_OF_RECORD.md`](current/SYSTEM_OF_RECORD.md), the current file
wins. Archived docs are true as of the date in their folder name.

## Current vs. historical at a glance

| Topic | Current (read this) | Historical (why it is that way) |
|---|---|---|
| Overall architecture | [`current/SYSTEM_OF_RECORD.md`](current/SYSTEM_OF_RECORD.md) §1, §6 | [`2026-09-04-foundation/ARCHITECTURE.md`](archive/2026-09-04-foundation/ARCHITECTURE.md) (design-phase, superseded), [`2026-09-09-four-area-refactor/`](archive/2026-09-09-four-area-refactor/) (the split into layers) |

| Code complexity / size debt | [`current/AGENT_RULES.md`](current/AGENT_RULES.md) RULE 16, 18, 19 | [`2026-09-11-cc-tail/`](archive/2026-09-11-cc-tail/CC_TAIL_FIXES_DESIGN_2026-09-11.md) (the round that took CC > 10 from 63 functions to 0), [`2026-09-11-rules-appendices/`](archive/2026-09-11-rules-appendices/) |
| Size, parameter and test-debt rounds (F, G) | [`current/AGENT_RULES.md`](current/AGENT_RULES.md) RULE 16 / 18 / 19, and this map | [`2026-09-12-round-f-size-tail/`](archive/2026-09-12-round-f-size-tail/) (the 500-line tail and the two god classes), [`2026-09-13-round-f/`](archive/2026-09-13-round-f/) (the parameter objects), [`2026-09-13-round-g-write-gate/`](archive/2026-09-13-round-g-write-gate/) (the tail inventory and the executed steps G1–G7), [`2026-09-13-rules-appendices/`](archive/2026-09-13-rules-appendices/) |
| Where Round H will work (JS gate, spine, cohesion, verification) | [`archive/2026-09-14-round-h/ROUND_H_DESIGN_2026-09-14.md`](archive/2026-09-14-round-h/ROUND_H_DESIGN_2026-09-14.md), and [`reports/CODE_QUALITY_METRICS_2026-09-14.md`](../reports/CODE_QUALITY_METRICS_2026-09-14.md) for the numbers it is based on; Area D implemented in [`2026-09-14-round-h-area-d/AREA_D_IMPLEMENTATION_2026-09-14.md`](archive/2026-09-14-round-h-area-d/AREA_D_IMPLEMENTATION_2026-09-14.md) with tools `file_coverage_floor.py`, `double_audit.py`, `mutation_platform.py`, `smell_inventory.py` | [`2026-09-13-round-g-write-gate/`](archive/2026-09-13-round-g-write-gate/) (the round whose tail it inherits), [`2026-09-13-ai-bot-chat/BOT_CHAT_DEFECTS_2026-09-13.md`](archive/2026-09-13-ai-bot-chat/BOT_CHAT_DEFECTS_2026-09-13.md) (the fake-double defect that motivates the verification area) |

## Maintaining this (RULE 17)

* **Never add a new top-level doc for a feature.** Write the design into
  `docs/archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<topic>/`, then update the rows of
  `current/SYSTEM_OF_RECORD.md` it affects and the map above.
* `current/` holds only what is true today. If a statement there stops being
  true, fix it in the same change that made it untrue.
* Archived docs are never rewritten to catch up. A one-line correction note is
  allowed (e.g. marking a deliverable that was never produced).
* Reference docs by full repo-relative path, on one line, so they stay
  greppable: `docs/archive/2026-09-08-one-db-one-world/DB_CREATION_DELETION_REDESIGN_DESIGN_2026-09-08.md`.
