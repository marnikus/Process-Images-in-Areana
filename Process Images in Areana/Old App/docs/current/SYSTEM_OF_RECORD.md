## 1. What this is

A **PySide6 (Qt6) desktop app** that automates the Virt-Chat web platform
(`ru.virt-chat.com/chat`) inside an already-running Google Chrome, over the
Chrome DevTools Protocol. The UI is HTML/JS (`ui/`) rendered in a
`QWebEngineView`, talking to Python over a `QWebChannel`.

Start it with Chrome on `--remote-debugging-port=9222`, then `python main.py`.
The step-by-step is in the [root README](../../README.md); nothing below
repeats it.

**One run does:** connect to the Chrome tab → harvest the user list by
scrolling → filter it → for each person: open the private chat, act (type /
attach / send), mark them messaged, go back → repeat. In parallel, a **passive
collector** archives whatever private conversation is on screen.

## 2. Current behaviour (spec, by surface)

| Surface | What it does today | Implementation | Pinned by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Action stack** | 17 ordered blocks, drag-and-drop, presets, per-block config panel. Blocks: `SCROLL_PARSE` `SEARCH_USERS` `CLICK_USER` `CLICK_MAIN_TAB` `CLICK_BACK` `CUSTOM_FIND` `WAIT_PAGE_LOAD` `TYPE_MESSAGE` `CLICK_SEND` `ATTACH_IMAGE` `COLLECT_HISTORY` `TAKE_PERSON` `MARK_MESSAGED` `CONDITIONAL_SKIP` `REPEAT_LOOP` `PAUSE` `SPEED_MULTIPLIER` (one coefficient scaling every wait of the run; last enabled SPEED block wins, resolved at run start) | `actions/*` (registry auto-scans the package), `services/run/` | `tests/test_action_registry.py`, `tests/unit/actions/`, `tests/integration/run_safety/` |
| **Find & click** | Every locating click goes through one two-phase, visually confirmed runner (RED outline on FIND, ORANGE on CLICK) | `backend/visual_click.py`, `backend/dom_highlight.py`, `actions/find_click_runner.py` | `tests/test_visual_click_contract.py`, `tests/test_find_click_visual.py` |
| **Scroll & Parse** | Harvests the CDK virtual-scroll list, reports each person as found, applies the block's own filter selects, purges rejects from the queue | `backend/scroll_parser.py`, `actions/scroll_parse.py`, `actions/scroll_parse_run.py` | `tests/test_scroll_parse_pipeline.py`, `tests/test_scroll_only_seek.py`, `tests/test_filter_purge.py` |
| **Run engine** | Plan-then-execute cycle loop, stop/pause gates, repeat cycles, empty-vs-broken reporting, JSONL trace | `services/run/` (see §3) | `tests/integration/run_safety/`, `tests/unit/services/test_cycle_plan.py` |
| **Passive collector** | Heartbeat probe per tick; archives only when the conversation changed; never blocks the UI; throttled (not paused) during a run | `services/collector_service.py`, `services/collector_tick.py` | `tests/test_collector_state.py`, `tests/integration/services/test_collector_tick_phases.py` |
| **Message archive** | Append-only per-person history, FTS5 search (LIKE fallback), paging that stays stable while collection appends, media downloaded and filed per person; every writer of the world file serializes on one gate | `stores/history_*`, `stores/world_lock.py`, `services/history/`, `backend/history_query.py` | `tests/test_history_*`, `tests/unit/stores/`, `tests/integration/services/test_history_service_contract.py` |
| **People queue** | "Who should I message under the current filter" — `users` table of the active world; shrinks when filters tighten | `stores/user_memory.py`, `stores/user_query.py`, `services/people_service.py` | `tests/test_user_memory_*.py`, `tests/integration/services/test_services_people.py` |
| **Labels** | Coloured person tags + include/exclude filter rule, per world | `stores/label_*`, `ui/js/labels.js` | `tests/test_person_labels.py`, `tests/test_label_store_orphans.py`, `tests/unit/backend/test_label_store_dbmode.py` |
| **Undo / redo** | ONE global timeline across every editable surface, one `Ctrl+Z`; an archive command is a task that reads the world back before it reports, and a refusal is an error, never a success; a DB-connection entry announces only what the DbManager returned (I-21), and a people-list entry only what the store says landed (I-22) | `services/undo_service.py` (facade — owns the timeline state and `push`), `services/undo_history.py` (`HistoryProjection` — the timeline and its stack/kind projections), `services/undo_apply.py` (`ApplyCommand` — undo / redo / applying one entry), `services/undo_db.py` (`DbCommands` — reversing a DB-connection entry), `services/undo_world.py` (`WorldSync` — rebuilding after a world change), `services/undo_archive.py`, `services/undo_timeline.py` (`TimelineCommit`), `services/undo_support.py`, `stores/undo_store.py` | `tests/test_people_undo.py`, `tests/test_archive_delete_undo.py`, `tests/test_world_write_gate.py`, `tests/integration/services/test_undo_support_contract.py`, `tests/integration/services/test_services_undo_gaps.py`, `tests/unit/services/test_undo_structure.py` |
| **Boot / world ready** | The page boots before the world is open, and BOTH sides are handled: a request that arrives too early **waits for the world and is answered** (`wait_for_world_open`, bounded 15 s — the DB window's `userdb_page` can no longer die unanswered), and once `startup` has opened the world the backend **announces the live world** so the People list, the Full User Database, the DB Connection window and the label pills reload. No refresh button is ever needed, at boot or after a switch | `app/lifecycle.py` (`startup` → `_announce_world_ready`), `services/world_events.py` (`wait_for_world_open`, `run_when_world_open`, `announce_world_live`), `bridge/history_bridge.py` (`_run_async`), `bridge/people_bridge.py`, `bridge/router.py` (`announce_world_ready`) | `tests/unit/app/test_app_lifecycle.py`, `tests/unit/services/test_world_events.py`, `tests/unit/bridge_safety/test_boot_race.py`, `tests/unit/bridge_safety/test_boot_chain.py`, `tests/unit/bridge_safety/test_world_ready.py`, `tests/test_userdb_refresh.js` |
| **Delete safety (DB window)** | Removing a person or a chat happens **at once — no dialog**; the delete is soft and Ctrl+Z restores both halves. The trash is **session-sized**: it is erased when the step leaves the undo history (cap / redo-branch truncation) or when a new app run opens the world | `ui/js/history-db.js`, `services/history/trash.py` (`begin_session`, `open_world`, `purge_tokens`), `services/undo_timeline.py` | `tests/test_userdb_refresh.js`, `tests/test_world_write_gate.py`, `tests/test_history_repo_lifecycle.py` |
| **Grid layout** | Any window in any cell; sashes draggable; layout validated before it is stored; **v4** adds the AI Bot Chat and Grok Prompt Editor windows and migrates any older saved tree | `services/layout_service.py`, `bridge/layout_bridge.py`, `ui/js/sash-*.js` | `tests/test_grid_persistence.py`, `tests/integration/services/test_services_layout.py`, `tests/test_sash_webengine.py` |
| **AI Bot Chat (Grok)** | A window per person: loads only **today's** messages, asks Grok for a suggested reply or a reaction analysis, and shows the answer **pending**. ✅ approve only *enables* "Send to Person" (approval never sends), ❌ offers 🔄 retry, and "Send Direct" is a separate AI-free path | `services/bot_chat.py`, `services/bot_grok.py`, `services/bot_reactions.py`, `bridge/bot_bridge.py`, `ui/js/bot-chat.js` | `tests/unit/services/test_bot_chat_service.py`, `tests/unit/services/test_bot_reactions.py`, `tests/test_bot_bridge.py`, `tests/test_bot_chat_js.js` |
| **Grok prompt editor** | The prompt templates are editable in their **own window** (opened by the `[edit]` button beside each action), with a live preview, Save/Cancel and Reset; edits persist between sessions in the `grok` config section. The window also holds the connection settings — the API key is write-only (`bot_connection` reports *whether* one is set, never the key) | `services/bot_prompts.py`, `services/bot_grok.py` (`GrokSettings`), `bridge/bot_prompt_bridge.py`, `ui/js/bot-prompt.js` | `tests/unit/services/test_bot_chat_service.py`, `tests/test_bot_bridge.py` |
| **Database worlds** | One `.db` file = one complete world; create / load / switch / clean / **permanent delete** | `services/db_service.py`, `services/db_lifecycle.py`, `services/db_deletion*.py` | `tests/test_db_manager*.py`, `tests/test_db_unified_world.py`, `tests/integration/safety_deletion/` |
| **Logging** | UI log console + file log + JSONL run trace | `backend/logger.py`, `ui/js/log-console.js`, `services/service_log.py` | `tests/unit/backend/test_logger_setup.py` |

## 3. Current flow

### 3.1 A run: plan → execute

`RunCoordinator.execute()` (`services/run/coordinator.py`, aliased
`ActionEngine`) — the outer loop owns only begin/teardown and the cycle count:

```
execute()
 ├─ _begin_run()                     cycles, state machine → RUNNING, tracer
 ├─ hooks.pre_run(engine)            (awaitable hook; may be sync or async)
 └─ for cycle in 1..cycles:
      ├─ _gate_before_cycle()        stop? → "stopped"  ·  pause → wait · stop?
      ├─ _execute_cycle()
      │    ├─ _try_prepare_cycle_queue()      ← PLAN
      │    │     collect (Scroll & Parse, if enabled) → check_stopped
      │    │     → label filter → check_stopped → order by column
      │    │     → TAKE_PERSON → check_stopped
      │    ├─ inspect_stack(stack)  → StackFacts  (one scan, pure data)
      │    ├─ choose_cycle_mode(facts, has_queue, take_matched, stopped)
      │    │        stopped → single_target → take-miss empty → queued
      │    │        → empty_stack → user-empty → standalone
      │    └─ dispatch                                          ← EXECUTE
      │          single_target → _run_single_target_cycle()
      │          queued/standalone → _run_user_queue()
      │          empty/empty_stack → _announce_empty_mode()
      └─ _cycle_transition(outcome, …)   repeat-loop stop conditions
 finally: post hook → _finish_signals() → cleanup-failure resolution
```

Planning is **pure**: `services/run/cycle_plan.py` holds the stack scan and the
mode table with no Qt, DB or CDP imports, so precedence is testable in
isolation (`tests/unit/services/test_cycle_plan.py`). Outcomes are
`worked | stopped | empty | empty_stack`, and "empty" is never reported as
success (invariant **I-3**).

Stop and cancel are honoured at every boundary: `RunStopped` → `"stopped"`;
`asyncio.CancelledError` always propagates untouched (see
`tests/integration/run_safety/test_stop_contract.py`).

### 3.2 Archiving a message (the only write path)

```
in-page agent (backend/js/chat_agent.js)
   │  binding: __cvbPush
   ▼
services/history/runtime.on_binding → Collector.handle_push
   ▼
backend/chat_parser.verify_private(state, nick, my_nick)   ← the two-step gate
   │  refuse → nothing is written, push channel disarmed until a tick re-verifies
   ▼
backend/chat_sync (delta/align) → stores/history_repo* (append, dedup, media)
```

The collector heartbeat (`services/collector_tick.py`) runs the same gate as
five explicit phases: `PROBE → GATE → NICK → VERIFY → ARCHIVE`, and its status
vocabulary is fixed: `Collecting … / Collected N … / No new messages /
Not in private tab now`.

### 3.3 Deleting a world (the only irreversible path)

`services/db_deletion_flow.delete_world()` — a fail-closed pipeline; a phase
that cannot verify stops the run and reports instead of guessing:

```
validate → scan → switch → detach → database → media → finalize
```

* **scan** (`services/db_deletion_scan.py`) builds the inventory: victim
  directory, remembered in-root `.db` paths, active folder. Anything outside
  that boundary is *not scanned and not protected* (`SUPPORTED_BOUNDARY`).
* **database** removes the SQLite file group main-first and stops at the first
  group failure; **media** unlinks file-by-file (never `rmtree`) and keeps any
  file another world still references; symlinks are retained.
* Result shape and phase/error strings are frozen: produced only by
  `services.db_deletion.DeletionOutcome.as_dict()` and pinned bit-for-bit by
  `tests/integration/safety_deletion/` (18 test files).
* **Clean DB** is *not* deletion: it backs the file up to `db_trash/` and is
  undoable.
* **One accepted exception, and it is legacy-only.** Nothing records a delete as
  an undo step any more — `bridge/db_bridge.py` guards its only `dbconn` push
  with `if op != "delete"` — so every delete made from here on is permanent with
  no Ctrl+Z (D4). But a world whose `undo_history` table still holds a delete
  entry from *before* that guard keeps its one undoable delete: undone, it
  restores the file from the entry's backup, and says so only once the restore
  has actually happened (I-21). **Ruled acceptable by the owner, 2026-09-13**:
  the functionality stands as it works, no migration drops those entries, and
  honouring an undo step a pre-D4 world was once promised is the intended
  behaviour rather than a contradiction of D4.

## 4. Current invariants (safety guarantees)

Each one is enforced in code and pinned by a test. Rule numbers refer to
[`AGENT_RULES.md`](AGENT_RULES.md).

| # | Invariant | Enforced in |
|---|---|---|
| **I-1** | A click never lands on a node the user did not see highlighted; overlays can never intercept it (`pointer-events:none`) | `backend/visual_click.py` (RULE 1) |
| **I-2** | Every step is reported; a block that fails silently is a bug | `engine.report()` (RULE 2) |
| **I-3** | "Empty" is never reported as success, and empty is never confused with broken | run engine + blocks (RULE 4) |
| **I-4** | Long loops report incrementally, and a UI callback can never kill the pipeline | `on_collect` wiring (RULE 5) |
| **I-5** | Only entities that pass the *current* filter are persisted; a stricter re-run shrinks the list | `on_reject` + purge (RULE 6) |
| **I-6** | A stop request is honoured inside inner waits, not just the outer loop; "stopped" ≠ "failed" | `actions/cancellation.py` (RULE 7) |
| **I-7** | A guard that skips its own work never stalls the phases after it, and counting failures fail **open** | `_run_collect_phase` (RULE 9) |
| **I-8** | One decision, one control — no hidden second filter | block config (RULE 10) |
| **I-9** | A seek writes nothing: scroll-only mode neither collects, rejects nor purges | `backend/scroll_parser.py` (RULE 11) |
| **I-10** | One chronological undo timeline for every editable surface; automatic side-effects are never recorded | `services/undo_service.py` (RULE 12) |
| **I-11** | State that cannot be read back is never persisted (grid layout is validated and rejected, not repaired) | `services/layout_service.py` (RULE 13) |
| **I-12** | The archive is not the queue: filters, purges, undo and People-list edits never delete archived messages; collectors never add to the queue | `stores/history_repo*`, `stores/user_memory.py` (RULE 14) |
| **I-13** | Nothing is archived without the two-step private gate, re-applied on every write path; the gate fails **closed** | `backend/chat_parser.verify_private()` (RULE 15) |
| **I-14** | Media bytes are filed under the conversation they belong to, never in a global pile | `stores/media_layout.py` (RULE 15) |
| **I-15** | Deleting a world is permanent and leaves no orphans; the last world cannot be deleted; a failed switch leaves the app connected to the previous world | `services/db_deletion_flow.py`, `services/db_lifecycle.py` |
| **I-16** | No `os.unlink` happens before scan + plan + switch + detach + revalidate | `services/db_deletion_flow.py` |
| **I-17** | One writer per world file: the People queue (`UserMemory`) and the archive (`HistoryDB`) take the SAME gate from their first write until the transaction ends, so no interleaving can fail with `database is locked`; reads never wait, and the wait is fail-open after 15 s rather than unbounded | `stores/world_lock.py` (`WorldGate` / `WriteTurn` / `world_write`), `stores/history_db.py`, `stores/user_memory.py` |
| **I-18** | An archive undo/redo reports only what the database now shows: both halves (people list + rows) are applied, the result is read back, and a refusal logs an ERROR, restores the list half, keeps the timeline entry retryable and emits `userdb_changed(failed)` — “archive restored” can no longer appear over a still-deleted person | `services/undo_archive.py`, `services/undo_service.py` (facade), `services/undo_apply.py` (`_apply_archive_command`), `bridge/history_bridge.py` |
| **I-19** | Deleted data lives exactly as long as the undo step that can restore it: a delete is soft and instant (no confirmation dialog anywhere), and the hidden rows are destroyed the moment the step leaves the timeline (cap / new edit after an undo) or the next app run opens the world (`begin_session` stamps the world with a per-run token; a different token means the trash belongs to a closed session) | `services/history/trash.py`, `services/undo_timeline.py` (`commit` → `purge_tokens`) |
| **I-20** | An unopened world is never shown as the truth, and it never swallows a request: a read that arrives before the world is open **waits for it (bounded, 15 s) and is answered once** — a closed `HistoryDB` no longer turns the window's first `userdb_page` into an error nobody hears — and the backend announces the live world once startup has opened it (and on every switch) so each world-bound window reloads. A boot that raced the database cannot leave an empty list behind a manual refresh | `services/world_events.py` (`wait_for_world_open`, `run_when_world_open`, `announce_world_live`), `bridge/history_bridge.py`, `bridge/people_bridge.py`, `app/lifecycle.py`, `bridge/router.py` |
| **I-21** | A world action undone from the timeline reports only what the DbManager returned: `undo_apply._log_command` skips `dbconn` exactly as it skips `archive`, and `undo_db._announce` writes the “↩ Undo — database restored” line from `result["ok"]` inside the spawned task — so a legacy delete whose backup is gone warns that deletions are permanent and never claims a restore. A refusal is *not* restated here: `emit_db_change` already turns `result["error"]` into a warning, and every `{"ok": False}` the DbManager returns carries one | `services/undo_db.py` (`_announce`), `services/undo_apply.py` (`_log_command`), `services/undo_world.py` (`emit_db_change`) |
| **I-22** | A people-list undo/redo reports only what the store says landed: `_log_command` announces nothing for `people`, and `people_service.apply` writes the ONE line, from the count `replace_all` returns, with the arrow carrying the direction and a failure logging an ERROR instead — so “people list restored” can no longer appear twice for one Ctrl+Z, nor once ahead of its own ❌. The kinds that may be announced from the intent are a **whitelist** (`_ANNOUNCED_FROM_INTENT`, currently `labels` alone, the only command kind that applies synchronously), so a new kind is silent until someone declares it synchronous: this bug was found three times running (I-18, I-21, I-22) | `services/people_service.py` (`apply`), `services/undo_apply.py` (`_ANNOUNCED_FROM_INTENT`, `_log_command`, `_apply_people_command`), `services/undo_archive.py` (`_people_half`) |
| **I-23** | No label is ever written without the user: an analysis is only a *pending* card, `bot_analyze_reaction` writes nothing, and the label lands solely through `bot_apply_reaction` — the one path shared by ✅ confirm and a manual pill click, so the **latest** human decision always wins and the AI can never overwrite it. Exactly one of the three reaction labels can be active (`ReactionLabels.apply` is a single `set_for`, keeping the person's other labels), and approving a reply only *enables* the send button — `bot_send_message` is the only delivery path | `services/bot_reactions.py` (`apply`, `_one_reaction`), `services/bot_chat.py` (`apply_reaction`, `analyze_reaction`), `bridge/bot_bridge.py`, `ui/js/bot-chat.js` |
| **I-24** | A message is delivered only into the chat that belongs to the person it was written for: `deliver` probes the open tab and refuses with `bot_wrong_chat` unless the partner matches, and an unreadable page refuses too (`bot_unknown_chat`) — the gate fails **closed**, like RULE 15's. Sending is the one irreversible act in the AI Bot Chat window and the window's person (picked in User Memory) drifts from the browser's open tab the moment anyone clicks another chat; `chat_sync` already refuses to *read* a mismatched conversation (`partner_mismatch`) and writing to the wrong person is worse | `services/bot_chat.py` (`deliver`, `check_recipient`, `open_partner`), `bridge/bot_bridge.py` (`bot_send_message`), `ui/js/bot-chat.js` (`_deliver`) |
| **I-25** | A reaction label set by the AI window is the SAME edit as one set by hand: `BotChatService.apply_reaction` runs the write through `LabelBridge._labels_edit`, so it is ONE entry on the global timeline and refreshes the Label Manager and the People count (RULE 12 / I-10). The label store is **injected** (`ctx.label_store()`), never read off the archive — `HistoryService` keeps its store private as `_labels`, and the earlier `getattr(archive, "labels", None)` silently returned None in the running app while every test passed against a double that had invented the attribute | `services/bot_chat.py` (`apply_reaction`), `bridge/bot_bridge.py` (`label_edit_of`), `tests/unit/services/test_bot_reactions.py` (`TestRealArchiveInterface`) |
| **I-26** | The AI Bot Chat window reads the archive through `HistoryQuery.page` — the SAME read the DB/history window uses — and renders media with `HistoryView.mediaNode`. It has no query and no media renderer of its own. The first version hand-wrote a four-column SELECT, dropped the `media` join, and GIFs rendered as blank messages; a media message must never be blank, and a media-only message must not vanish from the AI context (`item_text` turns it into a visible `[gif]` marker) | `services/bot_chat.py` (`load`), `services/bot_transcript.py` (`item_text`), `ui/js/bot-messages.js` (`_media`), `tests/unit/services/test_bot_chat_service.py` (`TestMediaReachesTheWindow`) |
| **I-27** | An unknown placeholder in a prompt template is a WARNING, never a silent revert. `is_usable` rejects only empty text; `bot_variables.fill` leaves an unresolved `{word}` standing in the prompt and `validate` reports it. The previous behaviour — treating any unknown field as "unusable" and falling back to the shipped default — destroyed the user's template as they typed. The original placeholder names (`{nick}`, `{conversation}`, `{last_message}`) are permanent aliases, because they are already in users' configs | `services/bot_variables.py`, `services/bot_prompts.py` (`is_usable`, `render`), `tests/unit/services/test_bot_chat_service.py` (`TestVariableLibrary`) |
| **I-28** | A prompt's variables resolve ONLY against `BotChatService.context_of` — this person, today's messages, this person's label. Nothing in the config, no API key, no filesystem path and no other conversation is reachable from a template, because the resolver is never handed them. `context_of` is also the single builder, so the Prompt Editor's preview is exactly what gets sent | `services/bot_chat.py` (`context_of`), `tests/unit/services/test_bot_chat_service.py` (`TestPromptContext`) |
| **I-29** | An AI **connection** is a named user-created instance of a **provider** (the vendor wire format, which is code): several connections may share one provider, each with its own key, model and endpoint. Connections live in `config/presets.json` under `ai_connections`, through the same `named_*` CRUD as every other named thing — there is no second settings store and no second way to write a key (`GrokSettings` is now a reader, used once to adopt a pre-connections install). Deleting or switching a connection must never touch another connection's key or any prompt template. A stored key crosses the bridge only MASKED (`xai-…mnop`) and a blank key field means "keep the saved one", never "erase it". A connection that cannot work is LISTED with its `problem()`, never hidden. **Every provider always has a row** — an empty store is seeded with one keyless connection each — so a supported vendor is never a thing the UI cannot reach |  `services/bot_connections.py`, `bridge/bot_settings_bridge.py`, `tests/test_bot_bridge.py` (`TestConnectionsOverTheWire`) |
| **I-30** | The AI Connections popup is the ONE place that chooses which connection runs prompts, and the ONE place holding a key, model or endpoint; the Prompt Editor has no connection control of any kind. Two windows that can both switch the active AI is a question with two answers. Its dropdowns — and the editor's preset chooser — are `DarkSelect` menus built from the Bookmarks panel's own `.layout-menu` / `.lm-sub` classes: a native `<select>` popup is drawn by the OS and cannot be themed dark | `ui/js/dark-select.js`, `ui/js/bot-settings.js`, `tests/test_dark_select_js.js`, `tests/test_bot_bridge.py` (`TestTheEditorHoldsNoConnectionSettings`) |
| **I-31** | The Bot Chat scope (`today` / `all`) travels with EVERY request — the message list, `suggest_reply`, `analyze_reaction` and the editor's preview — so the window can never show one conversation while the model reads another. BOTH scopes are capped at `CONTEXT_LIMIT`, and the payload carries `truncated`/`total` so the window can say the history was shortened; a silently trimmed context is a wrong answer the user cannot see | `services/bot_chat.py` (`scoped_page`, `load`), `bridge/bot_bridge.py`, `ui/js/bot-chat.js` (`scope`, `_countNote`), `tests/unit/services/test_bot_chat_service.py` (`TestHistoryScope`) |
| **I-32** | Prompt **presets** (saved wordings of a template) and **connections** are independent: they are separate config sections with separate verbs, and deleting one can never affect the other. Applying a preset only FILLS the editor — it becomes what the app sends only when the user presses Save | `services/bot_presets.py`, `ui/js/bot-prompt.js`, `tests/test_bot_bridge.py` (`TestConnectionsAndPresetsAreIndependent`) |
| **I-33** | In the connection popup, **browsing is not choosing**. `viewed` (the connection the form shows) and `active` (the connection prompts run on) are separate state: clicking a row only loads it, and **Save** stores without activating or closing, and **Select** is the single action that saves, activates and closes. Test connection and **Apply Preset Settings** never close the popup and never activate anything — applying only writes the provider's recommended model and endpoint into the visible, still-editable fields. Cancel and ✕ leave the active connection untouched. The dismiss handler must judge "inside the popup" on the CAPTURE phase — a delegated handler redraws the row first, and `closest()` on the detached node would call a row click an outside click | `ui/js/bot-settings.js` (`view`, `select`, `applyPreset`), `ui/js/bot-connection-view.js`, `tests/test_bot_chat_js.js` (browsing/Apply/Select tests) |

## 5. Storage map (current)

**One `.db` file = one world** (schema v6, `stores/history_schema.py`).
Everything world-bound lives inside it:

| Table | Holds |
|---|---|
| `schema_meta` | version stamp + validation parity |
| `persons`, `messages`, `messages_fts` | the archive (append-only; `deleted_at` tombstones) |
| `media` | downloaded image/GIF rows (sha256, path, state) |
| `cursors`, `gaps` | per-person collection progress, backfill planning |
| `users` | the People queue ("who to message under this filter") |
| `labels`, `label_assigns` | label definitions and per-person tags |
| `undo_history` | the world-bound half of the undo timeline |
| `gaze_data` | radar / observation session state |
| `app_settings` | per-world settings (my nick, media caps, …) |

**App-level (not world-bound)** — `config/*.json`, one store per concern,
written atomically: `blocks.json` `bookmarks.json` `labels.json` `presets.json`
`session.json` `settings.json` `undo.json` (`stores/json_store.py`,
`stores/atomic.py`, `stores/migration.py`).

**Media bytes** — `saved_media/<Latin nick>/images|gifs/YYYY-MM-DD_NNN.ext`,
one stable folder per person via a `_nick.txt` marker.

Legacy paths still work: a pre-unified `chatbot.db` queue is re-homed into the
active world once at startup (`HistoryService.migrate_install()`, idempotent and
non-destructive).

## 6. Key modules

| Layer | Package | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Contracts | `core/` (5 files) | DI container, EventBus, interfaces, `Result` — no Qt, no I/O |
| Blocks | `actions/` (25) | The 17 action blocks + `BaseAction`, registry, cancellation, wait-speed scaling |
| Page-facing | `backend/` (30) | CDP client, DOM probes, chat parser + private gate, chat sync, scroll parser, visual click, media handler; **compatibility shims** for the pre-split names |
| Wire | `bridge/` (14) | `bridge/router.py` — ONE QObject on the QWebChannel, assembled from eleven domain bridges: cdp · stack · people · history · label · db · collector · undo · layout · file · window-preset |
| Orchestration | `services/` (55) | `run/` (engine), `history/` (service + `trash.py` session-sized trash + `migrate.py` install migration), collector (the `collector_*` family), db lifecycle + deletion (the `db_deletion_*` family), layout, people, undo (the `undo_*` family: `undo_service.py` facade + `undo_history.py` / `undo_apply.py` / `undo_db.py` / `undo_world.py` + `undo_archive.py` verified archive commands + `undo_timeline.py` timeline commit + `undo_support.py`) + `world_events.py` (the world's clock: wait for it, announce it live) |
| Persistence | `stores/` (37) | SQLite world store + schema/repair, JSON stores, labels, media, presets, undo, `world_lock.py` (one write gate per world file) |
| Shell | `app/` (4) + `main.py` | Bootstrap/DI, window, lifecycle |
| UI | `ui/` (23 JS) | Grid, stack DnD, archive windows, collector panel, labels, db panel, composer, log |
| Tooling | `tools/` | `tools/metrics/*` audits, `tools/build_stubs.py` (headless Qt stubs) |

Bootstrap wiring is one function: `app/bootstrap.create_container()` registers
`config, bus, cdp, memory, criteria, engine, history, bridge`; `main.py`
connects them to the window and starts the qasync loop.

## 7. Tests

```bash
# Python (2829 tests + 894 subtests)
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q \
  --deselect=tests/test_sash_webengine.py::TestSashWebEngine::test_grid_in_real_webengine

# Front-end (27 Node harness files)
for f in tests/test_*.js; do node "$f"; done

# Quality gate that is executable (RULE 16)
.venv/bin/python tests/test_rule16_new_code.py
```

On a machine without GL/X11/NSS (apt blocked), build the stub libraries the
repo already ships a builder for, and put them on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/build_stubs.py .venv /tmp/stublibs
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/stublibs
```

| Directory | What it pins |
|---|---|
| `tests/test_*.py` | Feature-level and end-to-end contracts (db manager, history, grid, undo, media, private gate, blocks) |
| `tests/unit/` | Per-module contracts: `actions/`, `app/`, `backend/`, `bridge_safety/`, `core/`, `services/`, `stores/` |
| `tests/integration/safety_deletion/` | The 18 deletion regressions — result shape, fail-closed ordering, cancellation, shared media, symlinks |
| `tests/integration/run_safety/` | Stop/pause contracts, cycle event order, cleanup |
| `tests/integration/services/` | Service-layer contracts (run engine, history, db, collector, undo, layout, people) |
| `tests/js_harness.js` + `tests/dom_stub.js` | Runs real probe/UI JS against a DOM stub (RULE 8) |
| `tests/unit/bridge_safety/test_world_ready.py` | The boot broadcast: the real router hands the People window every user of the world and tells the DB window to reload — the regression for “after a restart I had to press refresh” |
| `tests/unit/bridge_safety/test_boot_race.py` | The boot race itself: the real bridges over a real world file, one request sent while the world is still closed, answered once it opens (page, stats, People refresh; a never-opening world is a bounded error, not a hang) |
| `tests/unit/bridge_safety/test_boot_chain.py` | The shipped boot order end to end: real `Router` + real `ApplicationLifecycle` + real stores, the page asking before `startup` opens the world — the answer arrives with zero refresh calls |
| `tests/test_world_write_gate.py` | The world write gate and the verified archive undo: cross-connection exclusion, fail-open, `world_transaction` commit/rollback, delete → undo → redo, a refused undo, the session-sized trash (a delete is reversible in-session, erased on the next run) |

**Frozen contracts** you must not break casually: the AREA D public-API
snapshot (`tests/unit/backend/test_backend_api_snapshot.py`), the QWebChannel
wire (`tests/unit/bridge_safety/test_router_contract.py`), the deletion result
dict, and the collector status strings.

## 8. Quality gates (summary — full text in the rules)

| Metric | Fail line | Measured now |
|---|---|---|
| Function LOC / params / methods | ≤ 30 / ≤ 4 / ≤ 15 | mean 9.98 LOC; legacy offenders tracked, not worsened |
| Radon CC / cognitive / nesting (new code) | ≤ 10 / ≤ 15 / ≤ 4 | project max CC **10** (no function over the gate), mean 3.09 · cognitive > 15 only on the two frozen exemptions · nesting max 4 |
| Line / branch coverage | ≥ 80% / ≥ 75%, never lower than baseline | **91.83% / 87.02%** |
| Baseline snapshot | — | [`reports/CODE_QUALITY_METRICS_2026-09-10.md`](../../reports/CODE_QUALITY_METRICS_2026-09-10.md) |
| Ideal sizes (**preferences**, not gates) | function 4–20 lines · file 150–300 · module 5–15 files · context file 60–200 | median function 7 lines (63.6% in band) · median file 142 lines — RULE 18, re-measured 2026-09-12, measured in [`reports/IDEAL_SIZE_BASELINE_2026-09-11.md`](../../reports/IDEAL_SIZE_BASELINE_2026-09-11.md) |
| Remediation order when code is over the line | nesting → cyclomatic → cognitive → **size last** | RULE 19 |
