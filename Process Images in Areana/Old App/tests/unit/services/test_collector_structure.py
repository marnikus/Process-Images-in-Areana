"""Round F step F2 exit gates — the `Collector` decomposition must not rot.

Design ref: docs/archive/2026-09-12-round-f-size-tail/
            ROUND_F2_F3_GOD_CLASS_DESIGN_2026-09-12.md

`services/collector_service.py::Collector` was a god class: 526 class LOC, 40
methods, LCOM 0.92. F2 moved the behaviour into six collaborators using the
convention `tests/unit/stores/test_stores_structure.py` already pins for
`stores/` — a part is built from the aggregate and nothing else, and the state
stays on the aggregate.

Three things make this split harder than the stores one, so each gets its own
gate here rather than a comment in the design doc:

  * `services/collector_tick.py` was extracted earlier and calls back into the
    Collector through `host.<name>` — 32 distinct names. That is a live
    protocol: if a name stops being reachable on the facade the tick state
    machine breaks at *runtime*, deep inside a heartbeat, not at import time.
  * `tests/integration/services/test_collector_tick_phases.py` patches
    `"services.collector_service.sync_conversation"`. A patch only bites if the
    code under test looks the name up in that module, so `_sync` must stay
    there — moving it would leave the patch silently vacuous and the test
    still green (the trap step F1 hit).
  * the facade deliberately keeps all 40 method NAMES. Bridges, the history
    services and the tests call them on the instance; only the bodies moved.

Run with:  python3 tests/unit/services/test_collector_structure.py
