"""Round F step F3 exit gates — the `UndoService` decomposition must not rot.

Design ref: docs/archive/2026-09-12-round-f-size-tail/
            ROUND_F2_F3_GOD_CLASS_DESIGN_2026-09-12.md §4

`services/undo_service.py::UndoService` was 418 class LOC / 28 methods / LCOM*
0.92 in a 573-line file. F3 moved the behaviour into four collaborators using
the convention `tests/unit/stores/test_stores_structure.py` pins for `stores/`
and step F2 used for `Collector`: a part is built from the aggregate and
nothing else, and the state stays on the aggregate.

Three things are load-bearing here, so each gets a gate rather than a comment:

  * `tests/test_world_write_gate.py` monkeypatches **`undo_service.
    MAX_STACK_HISTORY`** — a module-level name. Only `push` reads it, so `push`
    must stay a real body in this module. Moving it would leave that patch
    silently vacuous and the test still green (the trap step F1 hit, and the
    same shape as F2's `_sync`).
  * `bridge/router.py` imports `_values_equal` from here, `bridge/db_bridge.py`
    imports `emit_db_change` and `restart_world`, and
    `tests/integration/safety_deletion/test_bridge_results.py` patches
    `restart_world` on the db_bridge namespace. All three names moved, so the
    facade must keep re-exporting the SAME objects — a copy would silently
    divorce the patch target from the implementation.
  * no collaborator may import the facade: the parts are leaves, and a cycle
    would make the import order load-bearing again.
