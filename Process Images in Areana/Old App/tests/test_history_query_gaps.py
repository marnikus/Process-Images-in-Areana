"""Round F step F6 — the mutation survivors in `backend/history_query.py`.

The configured mutation job (`setup.cfg [mutmut]`, mutmut 3.7.0, scored in
reports/CODE_QUALITY_METRICS_2026-09-12.md §3) generated 1,141 mutants of
`backend/history_query.py` and left **9 survivors**. This file closes eight of
them; the ninth is an equivalent mutant and is recorded at the bottom rather
than chased.

The nine turned out to be two different kinds of gap, so they are tested at two
different levels:

* **The call `list_persons` makes** (4 mutants: the COUNT's fallback argument
  ×3 and the page SQL's spelling). Nothing in the selected suites could see
  these. Over a real SQLite file `SELECT COUNT(*)` always returns exactly one
  non-NULL row, so the fallback argument is unreachable by construction, and no
  suite read the SQL text — the real-database suites assert the *order of the
  nicks that came back*, which is the same order under every one of these
  mutants. A recording stand-in for `HistoryDB` makes both visible.
* **The values the helpers guarantee** (backslash escaping, the limit floor).
  Here the repo was NOT missing tests: `tests/test_history_query_edges.py`
  already asserts `_like_escape("back\\slash") == "back\\\\slash"` and
  `_clamp(-5) == 1` / `_clamp("garbage") == 50`, and all four of those mutants
  die there — measured by running each mutant against that file one at a time.
  They survived the *job* because the job does not select that file. Widening
  the selection was measured and rejected: that one file executes all 29
  functions of the module, which makes 910 of its 1,141 mutants reachable
  instead of 159, and the narrow job's ~25 seconds become something else (the
  reachable count is measured; the runtime was not run, so it is not quoted).
  So the same two guarantees are pinned here at the level the job measures — a
  page the UI actually asked for — and the duplication is named instead of left
  for the next reader to rediscover.

One trap, because it decides whether any of this reproduces: mutmut reads a
non-zero pytest exit as a kill, so where `tests/conftest.py` cannot import
PySide6 the job reports **159/159 killed, 0 survivors** — a false 100% that
looks like success. `pytest_add_cli_args = --noconftest` in `setup.cfg` makes
that impossible and is neutral where PySide6 does import.
